  <abstract>You don&#039;t yet speak Scala? Then let us invite you to a journey on which we will explore the outstanding features of this programming language for the Java Virtual Machine. As an intoduction we will briefly talk about Scala&#039;s key characteristics. Then we will explore this language and some of its typical applications, e.g. concise OO and powerful functional collections. If you are a developer and expect vivid examples and live coding, then you will like this session.</abstract>

  <abstract>Platform as a Service promise to host your application without a change, but things are not so simple and you can&#039;t deploy your legacy EJB 1.0 application to the Cloud without hitting some constraints.

During this session, I&#039;ll explain some architecture patterns to apply to your new developments so that your transition to the cloud is as smooth as possible, and required refactoring for your existing codebase.

As a practical illustration, I will explain how we adapted Devoxx applications to be hosted on CloudBees, and how traditional frameworks enforce technical choices Cloud platform has to handle.</abstract>

  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>The presentation introduces JSR 354 (Java Currency and Money). It is shown how this important platform JSR allows to flexible represent and manipulate monetary amounts in different currencies (including virtual ones). The presentation will discuss some considerations done regarding numeric precision and will also gives insights in more advanced usage scenarios such as legacy currency mapping, currency exchange, complex rounding, formatting/parsing and functional extensions. Also included is a short running demo that illustrates usage of the JSR.</abstract>

As the maintainer of the &#039;Casbah&#039; Scala Driver, Ross will discuss how much trouble an inquisitive look at the Functional Programming Principles in Scala course can get you into. Six months later and many lessons learnt, Ross now works on both Python and Scala MongoDB drivers for 10gen simultaneously. While introducing MongoDB, Ross will also look at the Scala Good Stuff™, as well as the bad, and look for ways to lower the learning curve.</abstract>

  <keywords>big data, hadoop</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Big data represents a significant paradigm shift in enterprise technology This session goes beyond the well-known examples of huge companies such as Facebook or Google with millions of users. Instead, this session explains the &quot;big&quot; paradigm and technology shift for your company. See several use cases how big data enables small / medium-sized companies to gain insight into new business opportunities (and threats).

Learn about solving the unique challenges of big data. Learn how to integrate data from different databases and applications into a big data cluster for further analytics. Learn how to implement relevant use cases for your company with low costs by using open source frameworks, which simplify working with big data a lot.

  <title>Big Data beyond Hadoop - How to integrate ALL your Data</title>
  <keywords>big data, hadoop, apache, camel, spring integration, open source</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Apache Hadoop is the open source defacto standard for big data solutions. A challenging task is to send all data to Hadoop for processing and storage (and getting it back to your application later), because data comes from many different applications (SAP, Salesforce, Siebel, etc.) and databases (File, SQL, NoSQL), uses different technologies and concepts for communication (e.g. HTTP, FTP, RMI, JMS), and consists of different data formats such as CSV, XML, binary data.

This session shows the powerful combination of Apache Hadoop and open source integration solutions to solve this challenging task. Learn how to use every thinkable data with Hadoop – without plenty of complex or redundant boilerplate code.

  <title>NoSQL takes over! Alternatives for Integration of NoSQL databases</title>
  <keywords>big data, nosql, open source</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>SQL cannot solve several problems emerging with big data. NoSQL comes to the rescue, but therefore it does not use SQL as its query language or give full ACID guarantees. Thus, in the future you will have to integrate these NoSQL databases as you integrate SQL databases today.

Different open source frameworks and tools are already prepared for this challenging task. This session demonstrates elegant alternatives for NoSQL integration without writing a lot of boilerplate glue code and complex mapping. Several examples are shown for all different concepts of NoSQL databases by integrating CouchDB (Document Store), HBase (Column-oriented), Neo4j (Graph), Amazon Web Services (Key Value Store), and others.

  <title>Spoilt for choice: How to choose the right big data platform on top of Apache Hadoop?</title>
  <keywords>big data, hadoop, open source </keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Big data represents a significant paradigm shift in enterprise technology. Apache Hadoop is the open source defacto standard for implementing big data solutions. An almost unimaginable number of solutions emerged on top of Hadoop. On the one hand, Hadoop distributions from companies such as Cloudera, Hortonworks or MapR offer packaging, tooling and commercial support. On the other side, big data suites from Oracle, IBM, Talend, and others are available to support the developer with modeling tools, code generation, scheduling, and integration capabilities.

This session shows and compares the most important solutions based on top of the Hadoop ecosystem. Different concepts are explained, pros and cons are discussed, live demos are shown.

  <title>Spoilt for Choice: How to choose the right Enterprise Service Bus?</title>
  <keywords>esb, enterprise service bus, integration, eai</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Applications have to be integrated. An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) can be used in almost every integration project - no matter which technologies, protocols or data formats are used. All integration projects can be realized in a consistent way without redundant boilerplate code. Good tool support allows efficient realization of integration problems.

However, an ESB offers many further features, such as business process management, monitoring, data quality or big data. Plenty of ESB products are on the market which differ a lot regarding concepts, programming models, tooling, and open source vs. proprietary. Really one is spoilt for choice.

This session shows and compares ESB alternatives and discusses their pros and cons.</abstract>

  <topics>Web</topics>
  <abstract>OrientDB is a NoSQL graph database which also includes a document layer (like MongoDB or CouchDB): since his first stable released it gained a lot of attention, enough to push big companies like Sky and UltraDNS to use it in production: it&#039;s written in Java and it&#039;s amazingly fast, since it can store up to 150,000 records per second on common hardware; moreover, thanks to being a graphdb, it can manage relationship so fast that, compared to traditional RDBMS, it can be more than 1000% faster than them.

In this talk we will see a bit of the graph theory, how OrientDB functions as both a document db and graphdb and how to work with it from its HTTP interface.</abstract>

  <abstract>For years we&#039;ve been used to the HTTP protocol, one of the reasons behind the web&#039;s success, a protocol able to scale up to billions of requests and beyond.

But there&#039;s more we can achieve, taking advantage of HTTP/1.1 hidden features, having a look at HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, the Google-proposed new protocol which is already making web faster.

Back to the basics: what empowers and will empower the web?</abstract>

  <title>The no-framework Scala Dependency Injection framework</title>
  <keywords>scala, macros, guice, dependency injection</keywords>
  <topics>Scala</topics>
  <abstract>Using a DI framework/container may seem obvious. But when was the last time you considered *why* do you really need one? After all, &quot;dependency injection&quot; is just a fancy name for passing arguments to a constructor.

In the talk we&#039;ll walk through some of the features of DI containers and see if we can replace them with pure Scala code. We&#039;ll start with &quot;manual&quot; DI, followed with using MacWire to generate the wiring code for us. Then we&#039;ll proceed to a no-framework scopes implementation (e.g. request or session), which are very useful in web applications. And finally, we&#039;ll see how to use traits to create modules (similar to the module concept known from Guice).

As a bonus, I&#039;ll explain how Scala Macros work and when they can be useful.</abstract>

  <title>The ideal module system and the harsh reality</title>
  <keywords>modularity,java,ceylon,osgi,design</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Scala, Ceylon</topics>
  <abstract>We&#039;ll start by creating a (subjective) list of requirements for an &quot;ideal&quot; module system, just to know how much more work is needed.

Then we will take a look at Java packages. We usually think about packages in a hierarchical way, yet they are treated by tools as simple identifiers. We use them for scoping, but Java only supports package-private scope. We could use them as a module system, but we create build modules instead.

I&#039;d like to show two approaches to solving this problem. One is Veripacks, a Java/Scala library which verifies transitive module-related annotations. Second is the module system in Ceylon, where modularity is one of the main features of the language. I&#039;ll also compare with OSGi, and show how it differs.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>The idea of the talk on the one hand is to sensitize developers that switching from ACID to BASE transactions is not only deleting some JPA annotations, to realize that it is much more than that.

On the other hand the JPA example and all subsequent mutations of the example consist of a lot of code. Even if the example is basically dead simple (2 entities and 4 actions that operate on the entities) it should provide a lot of hands-on information how to deal with the BASE challenges on a code level.

This way I do not only want to sensitize for a problem but also to provide a solution. Since BASE transactions become more and more widespread and since from my experience most developers do not know how to deal with it, I try to provide them with some hands-on guidance.

Long abstract: NoSQL, Big Data and Scale-out in general are leaving the hype plateau and start to become enterprise reality. This usally means no more ACID tranactions, but BASE transactions instead. When confronted with BASE, many developers just shrug and think &quot;Okay, no more SQL but that&#039;s basically it, isn&#039;t it?&quot;. They are terribly wrong!

BASE transactions do not guarantee data consistency at all times anymore, which is a property we became so used to in the ACID years that we barely think about it anymore. But if we continue to design and implement our applications as if there still were ACID transactions, system crashes and corrupt data will become your daily company.

This session gives a quick introduction into the challenges of BASE transactions and explains how to design and implement a BASE-aware application using real code examples. Additionally we extract some concrete patterns in order to preserve the ideas in a concise way. Let&#039;s get ready to survive in a BASE world!</paper_external_comment>

  <keywords>Fault-tolerance, Patterns, High-Availability, Scale-Out</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Web, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>For high-availability and for scale-out systems to operate reliable and robust we need fault tolerant application design, because infrastructure based fault tolerance is either not available or not sufficient. Thus, we must implement it on application level. But, fault tolerance is known as an extremely complicated and challenging domain. So, time to panic?

No, not really. Okay, fault tolerance is not a trival domain but there are a lot of high value patterns that can be implemented surprisingly easy. In this session, you will learn about some of these patterns, how they work and how to implement them based on real-life code examples. Just a small step for a developer, but a giant leap for operations!</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>The idea of this talk on the one hand is to sensitize developers about the importance of operations (&quot;It&#039;s all about production!&quot;), i.e. we should not develop code for ourselves or for QA but we should always target at production. Unfortunately from my experience most developers either do not care much about robust and fault tolerant software design or they do not know how to do it. Actually I think often most developers shy away from fault tolerance (&quot;Whoa! This is big stuff - too much for me/this project.&quot;). Here I want to sensitize that we need to care about fault tolerant software design.

On the other hand I try to provide people with some hands-on solutions - code examples for some effective patterns which can help to make systems a lot more stable in production. Providing this hands-on code I try to help people to lose their fear of fault tolerant design a bit (&quot;Hey, that&#039;s quite straightforward! Let&#039;s try that ourselves in our projects.&quot;). At least I hope it will have this effect ... ;-)

Long abstract: Especially scale-out systems, but also more traditional, highly available systems need a fault tolerant application design, because the standard fault tolerance mechanisms on infrastructure level are either not available or not sufficient and therefore must be implemented on application level. On the other hand fault tolerance is known as an extremely complicated and challenging domain. So, time to panic?

No, not really. Okay, fault tolerant application design is not a trivial domain but there are a lot of patterns which will give a lot of value while being implemented surprisingly easy. In this session, you will learn about some of these patterns like the leaky bucket container, the load shedder and more. You will also learn how to implement them based on real-life code examples.

Those patterns are always extremely useful, also outside the domain of scale-out applications. Yet, very often they do not become implemented, simply because no one knowns how easy it is. After this session you will know better!</paper_external_comment>

  <paper_external_comment>The idea of this talk is to sensitize developers to care more about production-ready software. I see a lot of discussions in the developer community about writing better code (clean code, software craftsmanship, ...) but all of those discussions are limited to the developers point of view, i.e. how to get better readable or (sometimes) changeable code. What it means to get code really ready for production, not just for QA or the next sprint demo in some playground environment usually remains unregarded.

From my experience it is not enough backtrack to the position of many agile purists that production is just another stakeholder who adds his requirements to the backlog. Even if production is treated as a stakeholder (which is usually not the case until 3 weeks before go-live), many developers most often have no idea how to deal with those requirements. Thus, the idea of this talk is not only to sesnistize developers for the needs of production but also to show ideas how to implement solutions for them. For me that&#039;s a part of DevOps that is still missing in most discussions.

Long abstract: DevOps is all the rage. But, for many developers DevOps does not start before the build, it is &quot;somebody else&#039;s problem&quot;. Though DevOps starts at the design and implementation of a software. From a DevOps perspective it is crucial for a developer to understand how to write &quot;good&quot; applications in terms of running the application in production. What is important for an admin and how does it affect my software design and implementation?

In this session you will learn how configuration and monitoring can make a real difference, why fault-tolerant design is crucial, the meaning of a good logging and some more things. And most important: You will not only learn about the &quot;Why&quot; but also the &quot;How&quot;: Design and implementation based on real-life code examples. Get your application &quot;DevOps-ready&quot; ... and see how your admin will start to smile ... ;-)

  <title>Composable Software Architecture with Spring</title>
  <keywords>java,spring,composable,architecture,enterprise</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>What does the architecture of a modern enterprise Java application look like? What have we as a community learned from our past? What does it mean to design a composable architecture? And how can Spring help developers meet the needs of enterprise applications in 2013 and beyond?

In this presentation, core Spring Framework committer Sam Brannen invites the audience to explore what it means to design, develop, and test modern enterprise Java applications following a composable software architecture model. Along the way, Sam will show how the Spring ecosystem and programming model fit into the larger picture of modern enterprise Java applications.</abstract>

  <title>A look into the Glassfish Aquarium - Bean Validation 1.1 and CDI 1.1</title>
  <keywords>JEE, CDI, Bean Validation, JSR</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE)</topics>
  <abstract>Java EE plays a big role in defining standards for enterprise development. In December 2009 Java EE 6 was released and now in 2013 its successor EE7 will finally be available. Its reference implementation is Glassfish 4 which integrates more than 30 JSRs. In this talk we have a closer look at two of these JSRs, namely JSR 349 (Bean Validation 1.1) and JSR 346 (CDI 1.1). What&#039;s new in each respective JSR? And how do these JSRs interact with EE7 and each other?

Topics covered are Bean Validation&#039;s group conversion, method validation and the Liskov substitution principle? On the CDI side we will look at portable extensions, interceptors and archive packaging. </abstract>

  <abstract>You spend your precious time building the perfect application. You do everything right. It all pays off eventually, and you end up with a beautiful code base that is not only reliable but also performs well. You proudly watch your baby grow, as new users come in bringing more traffic your way and craving new features. One morning, you wake up to servers crashing under load, and data stores failing to keep up with all the demand. You find yourself stuck between having to rewrite the whole application and a hard place. It&#039;s frustrating, dreadful, and painful to say the least. Don&#039;t be that guy! Save your soul before it&#039;s too late, and come to learn how to build, deploy, and maintain enterprise-grade Java applications that scale from day one.</abstract>

  <abstract>There has been a strong connection between the terms &quot;web&quot; and &quot;online&quot; for years. The rise of HTML5 and the support of offline mode in most modern browsers changed the play of the game. Web applications are able to be run in an offline mode, thanks to HTML5 support for client-side storage for data and static assets. Since 15% of all mobile apps are launched when the device is offline, it is quite likely you are going to have to deal with the offline data experience in your projects. This session will introduce the different ways of storing data on the client as well as pointing out the limitation of each of the different techniques.</abstract>

  <topics>Mobile First/ Responsive Design/ UX, Frameworks, Native vs Web: Use Cases/ Tools/ Best Practices, Mobile</topics>
  <abstract>The shift in client devices to smart phones and tablets the hot area today is building on-device mobile apps. How do you take your Java skills and translate them to on-device development? Can you actually leverage the language and development approach you are already familiar with in this new world?

In this session we&#039;ll introduce you to Oracle ADF Mobile - a framework that lets you develop a single application that can install and run on both iOS and Android devices. You&#039;ll be coding logic in Java and leveraging a components based MVC approach to build mobile UIs with HTML5.

The session will feature a complete application development demonstration as well as a discussion of the architecture used by the framework.

  <abstract>Finally Java is getting lambda expressions, allowing to employ some functional techniques into its strongly object oriented paradigm. Nevertheless not all the Java developers are convinced of their usefulness or anyway know how to leverage them to write more expressive, readable, reusable and effective software. Functional programming, indeed, requires a big mindshift from the imperative style we are used to. The purpose of this talk is to show, with a set of examples developed during a live coding session, how functional programming can make us better Java developer and help to avoid or limit some bad habits inherited from our OOP backgroud, like the abuse of side effects, external iterations, null references and exceptions in our code.</abstract>

  <keywords>Collaboration, Motivation</keywords>
  <topics>Keynote, Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps</topics>
  <abstract>With Kick-Ass Software Development you actually get stuff done. Feedback cycles are short, code quality is awesome and customers get the features they lust after. Less mangers managing, less testers testing and less IT-operators operating. The developers take the power back, making them much happier. Sound like paradise? It is!

This session will show you how we do Kick-Ass Software Development at Atlassian. I will talk about how we: use pull requests for better code quality; collaborate fast to develop ideas; tighten our feedback loops to fail faster; shorten our release cycles; and work together happily on different continents. It’s a great way to develop software and we think it can work in your company, too.</abstract>

  <abstract>Category Theory is to functional programming what GoF design patterns are to object oriented programming. Since Java is about to introduce lambda expressions, time is arrived also for Java developers to learn something more about functional programming patterns. Monads are probably the most expressive (and very likely the most misunderstood) of these patterns, so the purpose of this talk is to explain them, clarify with very practical examples how and when they should be used, underlline their advantages and show how they can be implemented in Java8 leveraging the upcoming lambda expressions.</abstract>

  <title>Finding and managing right people for your distributed team</title>
  <keywords>remote employees, distributed team</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>Author has never had a &quot;normal&quot; office or team that worked next to him. His company began using remote employees to save money, but later found out that with a little bit of skills and luck distributed team gives freedom!

It looks almost impossible task to find, evaluate and hire person that is many kilometers away, but actually it is possible. And there is no magic about this, just technology that will be shared in this presentation.

Managing remote team is a tough task, has its certain risks, but there is one key benefit that makes sense fighting for! You and members of your team will be free in terms of territory, the only thing they will need is a good Internet connection and off course your wise management.</abstract>

  <title>Scriptcs - C# the way you wanted it to be.</title>
  <keywords>script, c#</keywords>
  <topics>Web</topics>
  <abstract>Scriptcs is an open source initiative aimed at bringing a revolutionary, friction-less scripting experience to C# developers. Its goal is to provide a Node.js-like (lightweight, yet robust) approach to authoring C# programs from outside Visual Studio.

Scriptcs not only allows you to write C# with relaxed syntax and code semantics, but also without having to worry about a solution or project file, build tasks, top level classes, DLL references or namespaces. Scriptcs also integrates tightly into Nuget, and provides its own extensibility model, based on the Node.js modules and its &quot;require&quot; concept.

In this no-nonsense, deep-dive session, we will explore how to get started with Scriptcs and immediately benefit from scripted C#.

  <abstract> Can you tell which version of your software that is currently in production? What is being approved? And who built it and when? If it was compiled using the correct dependencies? Which Scripts were run? And who authorized its publication? If it has been properly tested?

In this presentation will be demonstrated how to establish practices, make use of development techniques and what tools are available to provide an environment where development, management and operation teams can collaborate and participate in the delivery of working software, with quality and speed in an auditable way. It will be shown which are the strategies you should use and what tools are need to apply DevOps inside the software development lifecycle.

  <title>Git - Under the sheets</title>
  <keywords>git, dvcs, process</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools</topics>
  <abstract>Git is rapidly becoming ubiquitous, but for many developers it still remains a mystery. Learn how Git really works from the ground up and be in control of your source control. Fear Git no longer!

Git is a powerful tool, and unfortunately can both intimidate and punish users who are possibly new from other source control systems, like SVN, and who might be unfamiliar with how it works. Learning how Git internally stores data can be one of the best ways to harness the full power of the tool. In this talk we start with the fundamentals of Git, learning how branches and commits are stored, and work up from there. At the end users should hopefully feel confident that Git is actually quite simple, and that there&#039;s nothing to fear after all.</abstract>

  <topics>Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>While Git is established in the Open Source world, we&#039;re only just seeing the emergence of DVCS in our daily jobs. How can DVCS enable us to collaborate in an a traditional &quot;enterprise&quot; setting.

The talk will dive deep into the successful git workflows used inside Atlassian. There is no size fit all for this topic and various effective processes can be devised and are in active used at our company. The talk will also cover tools, plugins and techniques used to reduce friction during the development of features and bugfix releases like for example advanced merge checks, pre/post receive hooks and automatic merges. It will also parade various Continuous Integration approaches that work well with git and are also used internally with great success.</abstract>

  <title>Technology Management - in real life</title>
  <keywords>Library Dependency Management central approach</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools, DevOps</topics>
  <abstract>We have developed AppWeb, a central dependency management for 300+ developers at 3 locations. AdNovum develops projects using different technologies: Ant, Make, Maven, MsBuild. All technologies contain different ways to reference libraries. The central library management is included into our build process that will automatically populate a central storage - our toolbox, searchable in a GUI. The tactical and operational toolbox are built upon this central dependency mgmt. This creates a common denominator and allows all developers to head into the same direction - technology management made easy. In the speech, we will demonstrate our tooling and discuss the advantages of such a central approach - and how it actually helps each developer.</abstract>

If you really need an online video of me, we are able to produce a video after my vacation (8. July 2013). Just let me know when this is necessary. 

Thank you.</paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>In recent years functional programming has gained ground over object oriented mainly due to the advancement in computing power.

The JVM is no exception, you can find powerful contenders in Clojre and Scala. However Groovy doesn&#039;t stay behind.

The Groovy programming language contains a wide array of APIs and features that facilitate a functional programming style, such as closure composition, memoization, trampolines, iterator methods and more. We&#039;ll explore all of these features that are sure to spice up your daily experience. </abstract>

  <title>Escalante: Uniting Scala and Java EE</title>
  <keywords>scala, ee, escalante, play</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Scala</topics>
  <abstract>Many Scala developers have formerly developed Java EE applications, but often when they start writing Scala applications they disconnect from the Java EE world. Although some of the EE technologies are bit outdated, others are extremely popular and robust. So, why not stop looking at EE as a single thing and instead take the best of the Java EE world and make it easy to use from Scala? Thanks to Escalante, Scala applications take advantage of both EE services and other mission critical services such as distributed caching, XA transactions...etc. In this presentation, Galder will introduce Escalante and demonstrate how Scala web applications using Play! 2 can persist data using Java EE7-based ORM technology.</abstract>

He&#039;s also part of the Infinispan project development team where he&#039;s building next generation, distributed data grid software based on multiple languages. Galder has been worked with distributed, highly available, systems for almost 10 years and during that time, on top of building systems based on JBoss middleware, he&#039;s also worked in the retail industry building extremely escalable EFT software. The love for distributed systems and open source software comes from his days at ESIDE faculty at University of Deusto (Bilbao, Spain) where he studied a master&#039;s degree in Computer Science. Finally, Galder previously spoken in conferences such as Devoxx Belgium, GOTO (former JAOO), GeeCON, SoftShake, Red Hat Summit/JBoss World and JUDCon.</bibliography>

  <title>Migrating from SVN to Git: Why you should do it now and how little it will hurt</title>
  <keywords>svn git dvcs migration workflows</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>Git is now mentioned everywhere when discussing best practices for software development - it is no longer the sole domain for open-source projects. Yet, the move from SVN can seem quite daunting when you have a large investment in process and automation. Over the last three years, Atlassian has moved all of it’s large projects onto either Git or Mercurial - In this talk, I’ll be sharing some of this experience in order to help you decide moving is the right thing to do and to explain how it can be done with very little pain.

* How Git and Mercurial are different to SVN and CVS.

* How your team&#039;s workflow will change for the better.

* How you and your team can get prepared for the migration without any downtime at all.</abstract>

  <title>Smoothing out the Rough Edges of REST</title>
  <keywords>REST WebServices API</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Mobile</topics>
  <abstract>Enforcing the cloud presence of an organization by exposing a RESTfull API is of extreme importance. It is a demanding and formidable task that can turn out to be either a great asset or a dire liability. This challenge is amplified by the vagueness of what a REST architecture is, and the diversity in approaches and opinions among the leading Web APIs. This session attempts a balance between the spirit and philosophy behind REST, and the practicality and elegance inspired by the principles of modern API design. This very idea is highlighted through a series of concrete issues that frequently surface while building or evolving a mature REST interface whose goal is not only to be complete and feature-rich, but also intuitive and practical.</abstract>

  <title>The Art of Metaprogramming in Java</title>
  <keywords>Java,Metaprogramming,annotations,framework</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Other JVM Language</topics>
  <abstract>Metaprogramming is the dirty little secret behind the success of many Java frameworks such as Spring and Struts2, and forms the backbone of many of the most fundamental APIs across the JEE technology stack. This session aims to introduce the topic and highlight, with code examples, the different mechanisms and techniques to take advantage of this underused feature of the Java Programming Language. This session will adopt a learn-by-example approach that combines the philosophy and theory behind metaprogramming with concrete code examples. No previous knowledge or exposure to the topic is required, but an intermediate understanding of Java SE is expected.</abstract>

  <title>The Eschatology of Java</title>
  <keywords>Java,JVM,Functional,Mobile</keywords>
  <topics>Keynote, Java (JSE/ JEE), Other JVM Language</topics>
  <abstract>&quot;What is the future of Java?&quot; is a hard question to tackle. It should be given serious thought whether you are a veteran with a lot invested, a noob trying to figure out what is worthwhile, or just a self-proclaimed Java hater. This session starts by introducing the concept of Programming Languages Darwinism to answer what really determines the fate of a technology. A series of questions will be addressed to achieve some clarity such as: How is the paradigm shifting? Why do functional programming languages matter? What is the state of mobile Java? How does the patent wars affect Java? What about the recent security threats? And many more... Expect this session to be controversial, emotionally-charged, and very opinionated.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>I give regular talks at conferences or Java User Groups - most of them in German - so I don&#039;t have a better English recording than the Pecha Kucha provided.

If there are special wishes I am open to give the presentation another direction:
- more focuses on OSS BPM (comparison camunda BPM, Activiti, jBPM 5, Bonita)
- more focused on Best Practices in Automation (for advanced audience)
- ...

Currently I would introduce why BPM matters, show how that can (and should!!) work in a Java eco system, demonstrate a concrete example with live coding. 

I will hand in the same talk for 20 minutes with condensed content - an option as well (live coding and technical details have to be skipped - but the basic idea can be presented in everything from 5 minutes onwards :-)). </paper_external_comment>

  <paper_external_comment>handed in a 50 minute talk as well - this is the 20 minutes alternative. It leaves out the live coding part and some technical details - but would be sufficient to demonstrate the basic ideas and motivate the people to have a look at BPM (which REALLY matters :-))</paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>HTML 5 has introduced us to the Canvas API, 2D graphics and the pleasures of plugin-free video and audio playback. One of the next hurdles we will face is native support for 3D graphics for simulations, visualizations and games.

WebGL finally has wide enough support that it can be used to create compelling content. The low level interface can be a little overwhelming, however, so we will also discuss frameworks built on top of it like three.js.</abstract>

  <keywords>semantic web, rdf, owl, sparql, bigdata</keywords>
  <topics>Browser limits and beyond, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, Enterprise Java, Web, Mobile, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Integrating data from a variety of sources is one of the most challenging aspects of modern software development. This is due, in part, to limitations of the technologies we choose and some fundamental misunderstandings about the world. At the heart of the problem is the issue of economics. We only connect information for which there is a clear return on investment.

This does not have to be the case though. New standards help lower the cost of data integration allowing us to consider connecting data rapidly and with much less effort. The Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) helps solve this problem The Linked Data Project is a Web-scale proof that it can work.</abstract>

  <title>Creating a Simulated &quot;Matrix&quot; Machine for Managing Time &amp; Space in Application Multiverses</title>
  <keywords>application simulation, discrete event simulation, playback, timespace, record, parallel universe, multiverse</keywords>
  <topics>Keynote, Java (JSE/ JEE), DevOps, Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>This sessions explores the potential benefits of using real-time discrete event simulation &amp; playback to monitor and manage hugely distributed systems. In doing so it creates a matrix for machines and then looks at how behavioral signals can be externalized in this matrix for future self adaptation in applications.

What if for every application process there was another lightweight process that mimic the behavior of the real process in step and in real-time? What if operational monitoring tools could not distinguish between what is real and what is simulated? What if this simulated application runtime could mimic hundreds of application runtimes and thousands of threads in a single process?</abstract>

  <title>The FUTURE of Performance Optimization in CAPS</title>
  <keywords>adaptive control, quality of service, concurrency, optimization, control theory</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>This talks looks at techniques for improving the performance of systems that goes far beyond code tuning. It looks at advance techniques for adaptively controlling execution in response to variability in workload patterns, resource service times as well as resource capacities. It investigates ways of using prediction to eliminate latency on critical paths and then also explores how execution related to integrations or other non-primary functions currently present in applications can be replicated to other spaces and times for simulated playback.

  <title>MagicTest - a visual approach for testing</title>
  <keywords>Java, Testing, Tools</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools</topics>
  <abstract>MagicTest is a new test framework for Java. It features a visual approach which bases on comparing actual with reference output. This approach eliminates drawbacks known from other test frameworks: No assert statements are necessary to check the expected results, no artificial constructs are needed for negative tests, and it is easy to work with complex objects or big data. The absence of assert statements also makes maintaining tests much easier: changed test results can simply be checked and accepted visually without the need to change the test source. Finally all relevant information is automatically reported which makes your tests also comprehensible for others. So testing with MagicTest is not only more efficient but also fun!</abstract>

  <title>DNS and Java: Everything You Should Know as an Enterprise Developer</title>
  <keywords>DNS, Networking, dnsjava, Cloud</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Domain Name Service (DNS) provides critical internet infrastructure enabling end users to find your enterprise Java applications in the cloud. Likewise, it plays a key role in enabling your enterprise Java applications to find other networked services in the cloud, be it via the Google authentication API, Facebook social API, or Infochimps data access API. This session covers how DNS resolution works and, more importantly, how various Java APIs in the JDK use DNS under the covers, including the subtle effects of DNS caching on JVM behavior. It shows you how to safeguard your enterprise applications against DNS changes without degrading performance and availability, plugging third-party implementations into JVM, and other use cases.</abstract>

  <title>Compact Off-Heap Structures in the Java Language</title>
  <keywords>packed objects jvm value types</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE)</topics>
  <abstract>Whilst Java is a feature rich, there are still areas where it looks enviously at other languages. Native languages like C boast the ability to specify arrays of structures which has the benefit of being able to have compact representation of data and allow for the fast conversion of data into a stream of bytes (ie. serialization). It&#039;s possible to achieve the same things in Java by carrying out direct memory management yourself through the use of the Unsafe class, but as the name suggests this can be perilous. This session will introduce the concept of bringing C like structures to Java through a proposed Java Language change, and show the improvements possible for the memory footprint and performance of applications.</abstract>

  <abstract>Per-tenant resource management can help ensure that collocated tenants peacefully share computational resources based on individual quotas. This session begins with a comparison of deployment models (shared: hardware, OS, middleware, everything) to motivate the multitenant approach. The main topic is an exploration of experimental data isolation and resource management primitives in IBM’s JDK that combine to help make multitenant applications smaller and more predictable. Highlights include: A fine-grained tenant API; Per-tenant resource quotas based on the JSR 284 API; Tenant-aware JRE: run existing apps in a shared JVM without code changes; Challenges: handling misbehaved tenants, safe finalization, monitoring.</abstract>

  <title>Next generation java puzzlers</title>
  <keywords>java puzzlers</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE)</topics>
  <abstract>Java puzzlers are small java code snippets, which show an unexpected and supringly java behaviour. most of the time, these abnormalities are not relevant, but the can be the causes of very hard to find bugs. The knowledge of these rough edges is very usefull to prevent such bugs in the code.

This session is interactive, i.e. as an attendee for each puzzle you can vote for a possible solution. After providing the correct solution, we will discuss the abnormality.</abstract>

  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>Documentation is a very controversial topic, especially in the agile context. Many developers, architects and project manager (miss) interpret the agile manifest as a go anywhere ticket and geglect the concept of documentation.

From my point of view, in a agile context it is even more importent to document. But how do I do it? What shall/must I document and how and what must not be documented?

In 20 minutes, I show you why it is imported to document in a agile context and how to do it. I will present a comprehancie modell for documentaing a software for a developer.</abstract>

  <keywords>Eclipse IDE, Plug-In&#039;s</keywords>
  <topics />
  <abstract>The Eclipse IDE is a widely used development environment, not only in the area of Java. But let’s be honest: Eclipse does not really offer much out of the box. With plug-ins, the functionality of the Eclipse IDE can be expanded and enhanced. Plug-ins increase the productivity and quality of the work of each developer in a sustainable manner. This session presents several Eclipse plug-ins that provide benefits for every developer.</abstract>

  <abstract>We start by describing the goals of our development process: traceability, automatisation, transparency, insurance. Next, we describe our test environment. And how Jenkins is orchestrating this mess: Linux boxes in Amacon EC2, Mac Minis for the Mac support, Windows instances in VirtualBoxes, an ancient SPARC.

Now we are ready to demonstrate how we configure the builds. And then to the most interesting part - how we run acceptance tests on each platform. Acceptance testing involves launching different application servers on different JDKs on the aforementioned platforms. And executing different tests on them - verifying correctness of the algos and the performance criteria.</abstract>

  <abstract>OutOfMemoryErrors are quite common reason of application&#039;s crashes in production environment. Firstly we briefly discuss different possible causes of them and move to one specific problem: memory leak. This is the most common and the most dreadful of them all, as it very secretive in nature: your application&#039;s performance will suffer from memory leak long before it crashes. So your clients will notice the problem much earlier than you.

We then talk about different ways Ops and Devs can use to monitor memory leak situation, how Devs can solve them and how Ops can help by providing required information in timely manner.</abstract>

  <abstract>During the talk I will be debugging a simple web application using standard Java frameworks and libraries. What makes this application special is that it contains ten different Permanent Generation memory leaks. Or Metaspace leaks, if you are using Java 8 already. You will find me dealing with problems originating from database drivers, connection pool configurations, logger initialization, JNDI context handling, thread pools and other topics.

All the leaks originate from real world applications and stand a chance to exist in your own Java EE deployments.

I will describe each of these leaks explaining how this particular code leaks memory. In all the cases I will also demonstrate an example how to fix the leak.</abstract>

  <title>Busy Developer&#039;s Guide to Quickly Integrating HTML5 with Java EE 7</title>
  <keywords>HTML5, Java EE</keywords>
  <topics>Keynote, Frameworks, Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java, Web</topics>
  <abstract>HTML5 has suddenly become a hot item, even in the Java ecosystem. How do the &#039;old&#039; technologies of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS relate to the Java EE platform and can Java developers really be productive in this new/old world? Java EE specifications such as EJB, CDI, and JPA have standardized the back-end of applications, while the front-end continues to remain unstandardized, with some developers using JSF, while others increasingly use JavaScript.

We will explore multiple aspects of application development, while you will learn everything you need to know in this area, and see live demos in NetBeans IDE to illustrate the relevance of HTML5 in the Java world.</abstract>

  <title>Strategies for Loose Coupling in Large Java Desktop Applications</title>
  <keywords>desktop, Java, architecture</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>Large Java desktop applications are found throughout the software world, typically in back offices doing behind the scenes work, for example, in air traffic control, defense force simulations, risk managament analysis, and, generally, in the processing and visualization of large sets of data. Such applications will never completely run in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile phone. These applications, typically very well hidden, are doing mission critical work.

In this session, you will learn strategies for simplifying the work that needs to be done when creating and maintaining such applications in Java.</abstract>

  <abstract>Technical progress permits to construct and link new kind of intelligent wearable and implantable medical devices. They can monitor the health of the patient, call for help or act directly, like a pacemaker or an insulin pump. Developing such complex cyber-physical systems requires a blend of skills: (embedded, real-time systems) + (mobile, Web). Today they represent two fairly separated cultures. One need is the precision and rigor of safety-critical systems, controlled reaction times and power limitations, the other is the flexibility of networked, heterogeneous environment. Another challenge is the security and privacy preserving management of big data. It will be a major field for open-minded developers like you - go for it!</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>I see &quot;Keynote&quot; as an option to choose - may the speaker suggest to consider his speech as a keynote or do you invite the keynote speakers?
My speech regards the future of the technology and of the profession, it could be of general interest.
I have marked the field to catch your attention - the decision is yours.

  <abstract>The fact that Clojure is a dialect of Lisp makes it feel completely alien to Java developers, and they miss the opportunity to learn this dynamic and functional programming language for the JVM. Clojure’s focus on immutability makes it very useful for concurrency. This presentation introduces Clojure in a way that feels natural to Java developers. By seeing how well Clojure interoperates with Java, you will learn how to take advantage of this wonderful language and still use all the frameworks and features of the JVM.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Adopting Scala was quite natural for many Java developers. They could write their code in a way they were used to and as they learned the language they could start using more advanced features. 

However, Clojure feels much harder and different. In this talk I will not focus on all the cool things you can do in Clojure, instead I will show how your existing knowledge for writing Java can be used in Clojure and as you learn more you can use the more advanced features. 

Will be held at JavaOne 2013. </paper_external_comment>

  <title>Datomic vs EventStore - Scalability through immutability</title>
  <keywords>cqrs,eventsourcing,ddd</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Both Datomic and Greg Young&#039;s EventStore use immutability to achieve scalability. However, they take completely different tradeoffs and achieve different goals. Datatomic has amazing query scalability, but can only process a single transaction at a time. The EventStore isolate the scope of a transaction and can therefore consistently handle concurrent writes. In this presentation we briefly describe both models and compare the architectural goals and tradeoffs. Along the way we learn about persistence in general, CQRS and DDD concepts such as Aggregates and Projections.</abstract>

  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps</topics>
  <abstract>Agile development teams often work at a fast pace. How do you ensure every member of the team is aware of project goals, development and test plans? How can you get development teams to collaborate on code? The answer is peer code and artifact review. Mark provides examples of how expanded development teams of product managers, developers and quality teams can review each other’s user stories, code and test plans, resulting in better performance. He offers research-based tips on the mechanics of lightweight reviews and compares five common review styles, presenting research from Karl Wiegers, Frank W. Blakely and others. Attendees learn specific benefits of review, including ROI and the goal of producing higher quality software faster.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>In this session, attendees learn benefits of cross-department peer review – how sharing user stories, development documents and test plans across the team results in higher quality product; ROI of producing quality code before product reaches QA – and especially before it reaches the customer; and what research tells us about how to conduct peer reviews; how many lines of code to review at one time, how long to spend doing code review, the optimal rate of inspection and the benefits of author preparation. This session is in an “interactive lecture” format. I present research findings, explain two case studies and interact with the audience by hearing their stories and responding to their issues. The entire session involves the audience and ensures engagement.</paper_external_comment>

  <title>Inserting security in the development cycle of JSF applications</title>
  <keywords>JSF, Web security, security, </keywords>
  <topics>Web</topics>
  <abstract>Today programming a web application in Java requires the use of a complex integrated framework, like JSF, Struts or Spring. On the other hand, web attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Web security is more and more important and is nevertheless hard to integrate in a software development. We present how most of the web security risks can be mitigated for Java Server Faces by using a library covering them.

We will present the vulnerabilities that most of JSF projects have. They can be found at each step of the JSF life cycle. We present the solutions that can protect a project, even when the programmers are not security specialists. The solution must be easy to integrate and must have some interaction with all JSF life cycle steps.</abstract>

  <title>Appway 6.0 - How We Built a Distributed System</title>
  <keywords>Scalability, Elasticity, Failover, Hazelcast, Cassandra</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Creating a scalable, distributed system is a difficult task. Even more difficult, however, is to convert an existing system - which was neither designed for scalability nor distribution - into a system that has those properties.

This talk will show how Hazelcast in combination with Cassandra can be used to replace all of your old, non-distributed state with a new, shiny, in-memory architecture with flexibel distributed storage.

Scalability, elasticity, and failover are essential properties for systems that are deployed in the cloud. We will show how to achive them by using techniques like distributed maps, distributed messages, and distributed locks.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Hi,

The term &quot;paper&quot; used in the description of the last confirmation box is a bit misleading. I am not presenting a paper, but rather giving a talk.

Best,
Lukas

------------------------------------------------

Extended description:
This talk tells the story of how we moved from a non-distributed system to a
system that scales horizontally and has seamless failover behavior.

Problems that arise during such a transition are similar for many applications
and the solutions are therefore generally applicable.

The topics covered include:
- Scalability and failover
- Architecture overview using Hazelcast in combination with Cassandra
- General principles for making an application distributable
- Classification of data as a basis for choosing the right distribution model
- Job execution and scheduling
- Locking in a distributed system
- Network traffic analysis


Prerequisites for audience:
- Basic knowledge of Hazelcast
- Basic knowledge of Cassandra
- Some experience with concurrent programming
- Some experience in system design
- Some experience with distributed systems

  <title>Drombler FX – JavaFX RCP based on OSGi and Maven</title>
  <keywords>Drombler FX, JavaFX, OSGi, Maven, RCP</keywords>
  <topics>Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>Rich Client Platforms such as the NetBeans Platform or Eclipse RCP have become increasingly popular as they enable us to write GUI applications in a modular way and provide a solution to the „dependency hell“ problem. It&#039;s not surprising developers are looking for similar solutions for JavaFX.

Drombler FX is a new Rich Client Platform for JavaFX based on OSGi (Apache Felix) and a declarative programming model. It allows easy integration with Maven using a POM-first approach. Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as actions, menus, toolbars and other GUI components.

Drombler FX is an Open Source project and an Early Access version can be retrieved from Maven Central.</abstract>

  <title>SOAP testing done right!</title>
  <keywords>testing,soap,junit,groovy,spock,arquillian</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>Have you ever tried to properly test your SOAP endpoints? Sounds easy, but setting up a testing scenario is as pleasant as a weekend trip with your in-laws...

It doesn&#039;t have to be like this anymore! On the example of soap-ws, project authored by me, I will show you how to consume, provide and test a SOAP endpoint in 3 lines of code. Using soap-ws we can forget about the boilerplate code and the configuration nightmare and simply concentrate on the job. Since soap-ws integrates seamlessly with JUnit, Spock and Arquillan testing is a real pleasure!

Don&#039;t expect any slides we are going to code all the time!</abstract>

  <abstract>You may laugh about it, but adding a single external dependency to an Eclipse RCP project may take more than a day... In this session I will present how to fully automate build and dependency management in your Eclipse RCP app using Maven, Tycho and p2-maven-plugin. As simple as that!</abstract>

  <abstract>Business project are intensive and tiring. Tight deadlines often make developers produce the infamous &quot;enterprise&quot; code, the quality of which is the least important factor. &quot;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit&quot; Aristotle used to say. Deploying our skills, however, is almost mutually exclusive from mastering them…

In this session we will cover 33 things you want to do better, quicker and simpler applying the best of Akka, Guava, Guice, Mockito, Spock, Byteman, Groovy, Gradle, Logback and others!

Using some real-life examples we will have a peek at the code, analyze the flaw and propose a suitable solution. Not only will we learn how to code better, but also how to raise the bar on a daily basis!</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>The session contains maximally 33 examples on topics such as design, coding, testing and productivity (max 2 minutes per example).

Example are well selected and fit one slide - each slide teaches the audience something new.

The audience will learn how to apply proper programming techniques, how to avoid common design mistakes and learn how to apply libraries such as: Akka, Guava, Guice, Commons, Mockito, Spock, Byteman, Groovy, Gradle, Logback, Bash, Git, Pomodoro and many others.

It&#039;s a power-up talk that help people to get the gist of the modern programming tools and teach the audience how to raise the bar on a daily basis.</paper_external_comment>

  <title>Guiding Agile Teams or What a ScrumMaster Can Learn From a Mountain Guide</title>
  <keywords>teams, leadership, self-organisation, project management</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>Leading people over steep and narrow mountain trails requires both professional skills and experience. Leading a team towards subsequent successful releases is no easier. As a mountain guide and a ScrumMaster I have noticed that there are several similarities between the two activities.

Looking at a trekking excursion I will tell you how to start a day (or a sprint) and prepare breakfast together. There will be a couple of difficult moments like trying to encourage people to get up after a break (introducing a change is hard task indeed) or suffering from acute mountain sickness (you are probably going too fast).

I believe that having yet another perspective on various management practices can help us become better leaders.</abstract>

  <title>Sonar in heterogeneous environments</title>
  <keywords>Quality assurance, software metrics, static and dynamic analysis</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools</topics>
  <abstract>Measurement and control of quality is an important building block for the development of professional software. In the Java and. NET world a variety of (freely available) tools exist for static and dynamic code analysis.

But a consolidated view of the measured values is often lacking which might leads to &quot;wrong&quot; interpretations. This can be avoided by appropriate attention but without a proper tool this task is time-consuming and therefore costly.

Sonar enables a consolidated view of common analysis tools of the Java and .NET platform in terms of the configuration and presentation of the results.

This session will demonstrate how Sonar is set up, what metrics can be collected and visualized in herogenous projects.</abstract>

  <title>Visualizing Code - a practical demonstration</title>
  <keywords>code visualization, metrics</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools</topics>
  <abstract>The visualization of large software systems allows quick orientation on essential parts in terms of quality and maintainability. Code analysis tools such as MOOSE and City code allow the presentation of surveyed systems in 2D and 3D. This session practically demonstrates how Java as well .NET systems can analyzed and visualized in CodCity and MOOSE. There are different forms of representation, such as Polymetric View, Class Blueprint, and the City metaphor, which are shown during the demonstration: In addition, it is demonstrated how static analysis models can be enriched with dynamic analysis results, in order to provide a &quot;hybrid model&quot; in CodeCity and in my personal tools, SharpCity.</abstract>

  <title>User Storytelling: The Lost Art of User Stories</title>
  <keywords>Agile, development, requirements, user experience</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps</topics>
  <abstract>Storytelling can be a simple tool for describing a problem or situation. Somewhere along the agile road, the story part of user stories was forgotten and we were left with a short template to describe a user’s need. It&#039;s time to get back to the roots of user stories and use storytelling to create an understanding between business, customers and developers. I describe the common problem of user stories, with examples how we lose the whole picture when focusing on a template that doesn&#039;t describe the real story of business. I elaborate on what could be the outcome if we brought back storytelling into user stories and examples of how I have described requirements as real stories during development of multichannel services and the effect.</abstract>

  <title>Visibility Shift in Distributed Teams</title>
  <keywords>distributed teams, working remotely, communication</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>Contrary to common belief, distributed team can actually make it easier to adapt an agile approach to software development. Compared with the co-located group, a distributed team experiences what I call a shift in visibility. The hours spent in the office no longer count, therefore more focus is placed on actual work done and business value delivered. If your team suffers from poor communication or endless meetings, working remotely will make this even more conspicuous.

This talk is based on my experience in working remotely for over 7 years in various environments, which led me to believe that working in a distributed environment is like using Scrum - it does not solve your problems, but makes them more visible.</abstract>

  <abstract>Observations on working effectively from home, based on over 7 years of delivering software this way in 3 different companies. In my presentation, I will provide a set of practical tips both on the level of the individual programmer and the whole team.

I will talk about the advantages of remote work (beyond savings on commuting time), its usual challenges, and practices used to overcome them. I will also share my experience on combining agility with distributiveness. Conclusions may turn out to be useful no matter where your workplace is.</abstract>

This will be a true story of finding ways for effective collaborative decision making, developers outvoting CEO and all of us learning to talk openly about money.</abstract>

  <title>Next generation tracing</title>
  <keywords>tracing, logs as data</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>In software engineering, analyzing an error in production environment is difficult. Traditional tracing does most often not provide enough information about program behavior before the error occurs.

In case of a program failure, however, it is crucial to present as much information about execution context as possible so that the software engineers are able to determine the root of the problem.

Attendants of the talk will learn how we manage to minimize the developer&#039;s effort to apply consistent tracing, how to relieve the source code from unnecessary boilerplate log function calls in the source code, and how to optimize the tracing data for an analysis tool.</abstract>

  <title>1. Groundhog Day: Object Oriented Programming versus Functional Programming</title>
  <keywords>Closures, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Scala, Clojure</topics>
  <abstract>It seems like Groundhog Day, where the programming community is reconsidering the argument of Object Oriented Programming versus Functional Programming. Languages like Scala, Erlang, Clojure. and the inclusion of closures in languages like Java is making Functional Programming vogue again. Has something gone wrong with Object Oriented Programming that is fixed by Functional Programming? Is the programming community maturing or taking a circular step forward? The session will discuss Object Oriented Programming versus Functional Programming considering the latest languages and trends from an advocate of Object Oriented Programming and an advocate for the new vogue Functional Programming.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>This submission was inspired by Dave Thomas’s “Development Next – And Now For Something Completely Different?” Jazoon 2012 Keynote, by taking a step back in considering the future direction of languages.  Both Jim Gould and David Smith are experienced speakers at technology conferences including presenting at Jazoon from 2010 – 2012 on various language and security topics.  The same format for the Syntactic Salt and Sugar Jazoon presentation last year will be used for this presentation, which received really positive feedback (https://twitter.com/swissmanu/statuses/217904732688220160 ).  </paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>SOAP is dead you may think, but there is still a lot of endpoints alive and kicking! There is a plethora of frameworks supporting SOAP but most of them follow the paradigm of explicit or implicit code (stubs) generation. Why do we blindly follow the same (anti)patterns after 8 years of having Web-Services on the JVM?

This session will be a critical whirlwind tour of SOAP reviewing the existing solutions and emphasizing some of the biggest drawbacks of frameworks based on the code generation. On the example of the soap-ws, a completly different approach will be presented. soap-ws provides a lightweight Java Web-Services stack that handles the SOAP protocol &quot;codelessly&quot; on a purely XML level, adding a bit of Groovy flavor on the top of it!</abstract>

  <abstract>Designing programs that are inherently immune to attack requires formalized software engineering practices. In this talk we look at the overall software engineering lifecycle and the critical points at which software security is a specific consideration. From third-party suppliers to in-house development, your process must offer a level of confidence that the software functions as intended and is free of vulnerabilities. Using threat models, code pattern analysis tooling, and more we show how Java security is being enhanced.</abstract>

  <abstract>Java was built from the ground up with security clearly in mind and is now the engine powering a huge number of business-critical systems. With this visibility and opportunity come attacks, and this session goes through the current state of security in Java in 2012 (including the Java 6 and 7 verifier changes) and discusses some of the attack vectors. It presents a couple of real-world examples and also talks about the real-world challenges in getting security fixes out quickly. Finally, it touches on hardware cryptography. Come learn more about the reality of security today and take away a better awareness of exactly how Java helps protect you.</abstract>

  <title>How Scala and Functional Thinking Can Make You a Better Java Developer</title>
  <keywords>functional, scala, closures</keywords>
  <topics>Scala</topics>
  <abstract>Although Scala compiles to the same bytecode that your Java applications do, it is a different language. Some of its innovations have been making their way into both the Java-language specification and affecting the way we write programs. So, how can it improve the way we approach our Java applications? It turns out that incremental steps towards functional thinking bring benefits! We cover Scala&#039;s use of closures, its mixins/Traits, its flow-control statements, Options, and more. We also cover general features, such as immutability, pattern matching, and collections, featuring code comparisons. By learning Scala&#039;s idioms and its Java improvements, you will be thinking differently as you go to write your next lines of Java code.</abstract>

  <title>Understanding and Supporting Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies in Your Java Application</title>
  <keywords>bitcoin,cryptocurrency</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>This presentation covers technical and non-technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, focusing primarily on the current such leader Bitcoin. The talk will cover the basics of cryptocurrencies before showing how those fundamentals affect the way that your enterprise application needs to be architected and also how it needs to behave. The technical implications of supporting cryptocurrencies include asynchronous processing (e.g., using asynchronous queues), new modes of failure/recovery, fault tolerance, and integrating new clients and processing systems into the architecture. The presentation will present options, considerations, and &quot;gotchas&quot; regarding these topics.</abstract>

  <title>STJS: Managing JavaScript application complexity</title>
  <keywords>java javascript transpiler</keywords>
  <topics>JS Alternatives: GWT/ TypeScript/ Dart/ CoffeeScript/ etc.</topics>
  <abstract>Have you already struggled with thousands of lines of Javascript code, maintained by many developers over a few years?

STJS (Strongly-Typed JavaScript) is a Java-to-JavaScript transpiler that outputs readable, recognizable code without imposing any extra frameworks.

In this presentation you’ll learn the main features of STJS and how it helped us with our project. You’ll discover how you can bring the strong and static typing of Java together with the fantastic existing Java tooling to your JavaScript code.

You’ll see how easy it is to use jQuery when you don’t have to look up the documentation every time to find out the exact usage of a method, and how easy it is to use JUnit to run Javascript unit tests directly in your browser.</abstract>

  <keywords>html5, tools, mobile, responsive design</keywords>
  <topics>Mobile First/ Responsive Design/ UX, Frameworks, JS Build/ Testing/ Coverage, Web, Mobile</topics>
  <abstract>How can you make sure that your next web application supports not only the desktop browser, but also all the other devices and screen sizes? The good news is that HTML5 makes it possible to develop an application that works across a wide range od devices. Another good news is that tools that make this easier now exist.

In this talk, we will discuss various aspects of HTML5 development for mobile and desktop browsers such as responsive design, MVVM frameworks, CSS preprocessor languages and the PhoneGap framework, and see how the NetBeans IDE can help during the development process.

  <abstract>With the persistent increase of processing power in mobile devices and micro computers, the applications they can perform are growing as well.

A mobile device can do and show what a personal computer can, and a single-board computer can act as a mini server, media center or a play booth, you name it.

By combining these devices with modern browsers and technologies, a vast number of appliances can be made.

This short presentation will cover a combination of a mobile phone, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and some A/D electronics, run by JavaScript, d3js and Java8 ARM and connected by the use of Web Sockets.

The end result: a basic multimeter, oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer running in the browser.</abstract>

  <title>Don&#039;t use Git</title>
  <keywords>Git, DVCS, SVN</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, DevOps</topics>
  <abstract>Are you using Subversion or CVS? That&#039;s great, whatever you do, don&#039;t migrate to Git! Git makes you work overtime, confuses developers with too many options, destroys the social interaction with your co-workers and much more. Git has unnecessary features like offline commits and cherry picking that nobody needs at his day job. Your code is the most important thing for your software development and you should use a mature technology for storing it. Let the kids play around with Git.

In this ironic lightning talk I will give you 5 reasons, why you shouldn&#039;t use Git always with a twinkle in the eye. So create a new branch in SVN and come to my session while you checkout the branch.</abstract>

  <title>Data Access Patterns in this day and age (of cloud, bigdata, nosql &amp; other buzzwords)</title>
  <keywords>bigdata, nosql, performance</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>For years we have all been dealing with persisting state in our beloved RDBMSes. Well-known &amp; accepted patterns for dealing with persistent data have emerged, which we&#039;ve all been happily applying. Yet, with the cloud &amp; data volumes getting bigger, new storage paradigms have emerged. So what storage types do suit these new use cases? And how should we best store and access that data?

We&#039;ll review the nature of these data storage types. Using examples, show how their access patterns are vastly different. And, finally, try to present concrete solutions on dealing with some of them. Some that simple, that you can apply them in your existing apps today. Others requiring you to rethink how you go about dealing with huge amounts of data.</abstract>

  <title>If Spock had known HTML5: A Mobile Web Tricorder!</title>
  <keywords>html5, mobileweb, internetOfThings, sensing, real-world</keywords>
  <topics>Native vs Web: Use Cases/ Tools/ Best Practices, Browser limits and beyond</topics>
  <abstract>SPOCK: Captain, I heard you want to rebuild my Tricorder native app with a mobile Web app?

KIRCK: Indeed, Spock, the time is right for HTML5 mobile Web apps.

SPOCK: How will my Tricorder sense the world from a browser?! It needs hardware that only a native app can reach!

KIRCK: Spock! Bleeding-edge HTML5 APIs can now access all kinds of hardware components, such as GPS, camera, microphone, tilt/temperature/orientation sensors, and the like!

SPOCK: Your are not talking about dangerous alien technologies like MediaCapture, WebRTC, Device API, Geolocations, are you?

KIRCK: I am indeed, and I will show you and the Jazoon planet how they can use this to build a new breed of mobile Web apps!

SPOCK: Jolly good! Scotty, beam us to Jazoon!</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>This talk would also be suitable as a long talk. In the short version I would not go too much into implementation details but mainly focus on the available APIs. The long version could go into more details on the code for accessing these different APIs.
PS: I can also make the abstract more serious if this one sounds just too much ;-)</paper_external_comment>

  <title>3 cups of Java drivers with a slice of Mongo</title>
  <keywords>mongodb, java, drivers, scaling, noSQL</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>In a fast-moving NoSQL world, MongoDB has profiled itself as a volatile, flexible and easy to scale alternative to some of the flagship SQL DBs.

We&#039;ll first look at Mongo and its main use cases and limitations, trying to go beyond the “white-paper use-cases”.

While Javascript is Mongo&#039;s best friend, Java isn&#039;t far behind with 10 different open-source drivers/wrappers to choose from. In the second part of this talk we&#039;ll help you choose the right one by creating a simple CRUD app with 3 wrappers: the full ORM Spring Data MongoDB, the blazing fast MongoJack and the barebone Jongo.

Finally, we&#039;ll report on our two years of experience with MongoDB in production at EVRYTHNG where it manages active digital identities of millions of products.</abstract>

  <title>Design your domain as a graph with Neo4j</title>
  <keywords>Graph, Cloud, Design, Tools, Java, Spring Data</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Web, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>The social graph of Facebook is the most popular application for a graph database. In addition, there are far more exciting applications, such as spatial data, financial trail, indexing, and others. If you combine different graphs, you are able to evaluate those together with the algorithms known from the graph theory.As a graph, a domain can often be easier and more natural designed.

This talk introduces the topic of graph databases and shows how to implement mediated models with large, complex and highly connected data with Neo4j. Subsequently, topics like querying, indexing, import / export, scaling, tools and APIs are considered as well. Finally, we examine the highlights and challenges in the use of technology.</abstract>

  <title>JTransfo, converting between transfer and domain objects</title>
  <keywords>transfer object, limit boilerplate code, security</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>JTransfo is a library which allows you to indicate in your transfer objects how they map to your domain objetcs. This allows you to avoid a lot of boiler plate code in your application. jTransfo can also help you with security and constraint checking. You can indicate which fields should be copied in which cases, based on tags which can for example represent user roles or object state.</abstract>

  <topics>Keynote, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps, Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>The amount of source code in projects grows into millions of lines of code. This makes gaining overview and insights about software development projects barely impossible. I&#039;ll present the Hypermodelling research results that make it possible to leverage Data Warehousing technology for software engineering. Data Warehouses provide consistent tool chains for flexible data exploration, navigation, analysis, visualization, reporting and management. The research results make it possible to re-use them for program analysis. I describe how program structure can be expressed in a Data Warehouse and show first and exemplary applications on top of that: Statistic code analysis, reporting, live code clone detection and code search.

  <title>Aligning five scrum teams - a hands-on report</title>
  <keywords>scrum scale discipline reporting</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Culture</topics>
  <abstract>The idea is clear: Scrum works, so let&#039;s use it for larger projects, too.

Instead of theoretical options on how to scale Scrum we will report from our hands-on experience how our five teams are organized. Specifically, we will talk about our horizontal disciplines across the teams, how we plan, test and review our progress.

A seconds part of the presentation will go into detail on how we do reporting in a classical project management model despite development works with Scrum.

You will be able to take along our ideas on how to scale Scrum to try them in your environment, too.</abstract>

  <abstract>Deploying applications in the cloud and Single Sign On requirement is challenging. It is even more difficult if fine grained authorization is required. This session explains the solution and shows customer use cases where applications with fine grained authorization requirements are deployed in the cloud by leveraging existing IDM infrastructure.

Fediz is a subproject of the Apache CXF project which supports Web Services with wide range of WS-* support in the security area. Fediz on the one hand provides Web SSO for applications deployed on-premise or in the cloud and on the other hand integrates with the Web Services security layer. This allows to support impersonation end-to-end based on industry Standards without dependency to vendor.</abstract>

  <title>Cross platform agile - how can programmers of different languages talk</title>
  <keywords>mobile development, development process, cross platform development</keywords>
  <topics>Distributed Agile, Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps, Mobile</topics>
  <abstract>The cross platform development question has become very popular with the growing number of users on different mobile platforms. There are many tools for this purpose, still they provide creating of very simple applications. For more complex and professional mobile applications, the native SDKs should be used. However developing separate applications for each platform is expensive and time consuming. Therefore optimal development processes should be used. In my presentation I will talk about the agile development process when developing the same application for multiple platforms, based on my experience of working in such a team. The presentation will emphasize on team collaboration, development processes and tasks scheduling.</abstract>

  <title>Continuous Delivery Antipatterns</title>
  <keywords>continuous delivery, agile, teams</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools, Collaboration Culture, DevOps, Continuous Deployment &amp; Delivery</topics>
  <abstract>Releasing and Risk start with an R for a reason. Continuous delivery is the buzzed killer for that.. or is it? We&#039;d like to take you to a journey through well-practiced malpractice, discussing some of the most interesting hoops people made people jump through.

While releasing and doing infrastructure in organisations big and small, ranging from (soon to be multi-million) startups to multi-million corporations, we’ve learned that good intentions, backed by poor execution and lack of thinking ahead, can lead to hell on earth. Growing platforms is tough enough by itself, let’s not make it harder with insane release processes...

Well, continuous delivery is a people thing. Let us share our experiences.

  <title>Cascading - talking hadoop in a better way.</title>
  <keywords>hadoop, cascading, big data</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Hadoop has been around for long and is used by many. It&#039;s APIs are however a bit.. dated.

Cascading is a breath of fresh air to these APIs. It empowers developers and allows them to speak a more expressive language, which in turn makes complex data flows things really, really simple.

Does it work? Yes! Does anybody use it? Yes! Is it stable? Yes!

While we can&#039;t promise cascading to bring World Peace, we will do our best to make you interested in one of the most interesting libraries of the recent years, with bits in Java and Scala!</abstract>

  <abstract>I really love cycling. I prefer it to working with computers, I really do.

Computers, with proper attitude, allow me to cycle while they do the heavy lifting.

I&#039;d like to share my experiences with managing environments. What to do so that &quot;deploys&quot; do not hurt, &quot;releases&quot; do not cause panic and why I don&#039;t have to know whether my last project had a 1000 or 1500 releases.

To make it practical, with a bit of existing, open-source tools.</abstract>

  <abstract>Most of us know that HBase is a NoSQL datastore relying on Apache Hadoop.

I&#039;d love to share my experiences of working with sizable HBase clusters, and recent new things this wonderful tool received.

Let me offer a journey starting at plain HBase API (with some real-life examples), moving forward to current state of OpenSource access libraries. Adding practical applications - including mixing with exisiting other data stores, I hope the trip will be worthwile.</abstract>

  <abstract>Do you like computer? Many of us respond with a &quot;yes&quot;, with a moment of hesitation. But when the question becomes &quot;do you hate computers?&quot;, some will respond &quot;yes!&quot; immediately. So what is it, do we really like doing things we don&#039;t like?!

Did you ever wonder why? Is it the size? Complexity? Can big exist without the complex? Let&#039;s analyze systems we make, big and small.

See where do we - programmers - get so much frustration from, and what we can actually do to avoid that!

From build tools through integration patterns to the presentation layer, let&#039;s explore and try to appreciate simplicity as a way of capturing happiness.</abstract>

Our devices are packed with sensors and data mining allows us to understand our user&#039;s goals - we should start to work with them.

  <abstract>A modern web technology stack not only enables robust and compelling cross-plattform mobile app development. With the addition of Cordova (PhoneGap) compelling &#039;native&#039; web apps are possible.

Given the vast amount of JavaScript libraries a sensible choice for the given project is important. With the right development setup good code coverage and continuous integration can be achieved.

On the basis of multiple successful customer projects this talk will showcase a field-proven JavaScript mobile approach on the basis of backbone.js, require.js, grunt and buster.js.

As a roundup an outlook towards true multi-channel application architectures with dolphin.js and open-dolphin.org is performed.

It is designed to make the life of web programmers better by not only providing a language with sane and familiar semantics, but also a rich and consistent ecosystem of tools and libraries. I will present my experience as a backend developer who ended up writing web applications after discovering Dart. I will show how you can easily develop robust and declarative applications with Web UI, a Dart library implementing future web standards like Web Components and Model Driven Views, and what I and other people have built with it.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Description of the general topic/problem, why visitors should attend the presentation, including highlights of the technologies/concepts the presentation will cover:

Dart tackles the problem of web development productivity by providing a structured and modular web language which allows for better developer support (warnings, completion, refactoring...) and code reuse.

The talk will cover the Dart language and its ecosystem, as well as the Web UI package, a set of tools for building rich web UIs.  Dart is designed to run both server-side and client-side but the talk will mostly cover the client-side story.

Dart is relevant to web application developers and should be especially interesting to programmers with a Java/C# background who are looking for a familiar platform for web development.

-----

Prerequisites for your audience: e.g. knowledge/experience in project management, etc:

Familiarity with programming in any mainstream object-oriented language. Familiarity with web application development is a plus in order to appreciate what Dart brings to the table.

  <abstract>The extension of the Web&#039;s foundation with new concepts such as Web sockets, and the rise of mobile devices as end user interfaces and increased makes applications outside the traditional asynchronous request/response model feasible. Online games are typical examples of such applications, but there are also other useful cases such as an instant polling and voting application presented in this talk. It notifies participating voters (typically using their smartphone) about new questions, voters can vote by a simple click and the votes are &quot;near-realtime&quot; aggregated and distributed the result displays to be shown to the audience. The application uses a lock-free synchronization model and communicates with its clients using Web sockets.

  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java, Web, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Time has come to start thinking about multiple data storage solutions while building applications. A single application can use multiple data storage technologies depending on its use case -- right tool for right job. The session will start by introducing polyglot persistence to the audience.Then we will see how to build location aware Job search application using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Solr. The different data storage solutions are used to persist different types of data like MongoDB to store Job data along with its location, PostgreSQL to store User data, Redis as a cache for User objects and other goodies, and Solr as a full text search engine. Finally, the application will be deployed to cloud.</abstract>

  <abstract>Should you learn a new skill set to develop mobile applications? Or can you use your existing skillset and convert your HTML5 + REST mobile web app to hybrid app? Learning a new skill set can be very frustrating and time consuming. In this session Shekhar Gulati, Principal OpenShift Evangelist, will walk through the steps you will need to convert an existing HTML5 + RESTful Web application to a Hybrid app using Apache Cordova. Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Restful backend of the application will be running on OpenShift -- Red Hat&#039;s open source public Platform as a Service.</abstract>

  <title>If You Think You Can Stay Away from Functional Programming, You Are Wrong</title>
  <keywords>Java8, lambda, functional programming, concurrency, parallelism</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE)</topics>
  <abstract>Everybody agrees that concurrency and parallelism are two of the most important aspects of today’s and tomorrow’s programming. However, after years of object-oriented programming, we take for granted a style—including mutable data and locks and synchronizing access to them—that often proves to be inefficient and very error-prone. This presentation shows the principles of functional programming and how it can make the development of concurrent applications easier and more natural, facilitating the full exploitation of the potential of modern multicore CPUs.</abstract>

This presentation shows the principles of functional programming and how it can make the development of concurrent applications easier and more natural, facilitating the full exploitation of the potential of modern multicore CPUs.</abstract_plain>

  <title>Continuous Lifecycle for mobile applications</title>
  <keywords>deployment, continuous integration, jenkins, puppet, virtualization</keywords>
  <topics>DevOps, Continuous Deployment &amp; Delivery</topics>
  <abstract>Today&#039;s applications are more complex then the simple stand-alone client or server applications which only reload on very few externel components, such as databases, web services, etc.

Today we have to deal with APIs being exposed to mobile applications on different devices and platforms together with distributed backends - how to deal with that?

How do you start writing an application to consume an API that doesn&#039;t exist yet, without writing something that does not work to spec?

How do you test these applications? How to deploy a big bundle of gems, libraries, configurations?

This talk gives an overview of our Jenkins-Github-Puppet deployment trinity we use to conquer these challenging tasks.</abstract>

  <title>CDI Reloaded</title>
  <keywords>CDI J2EE 1.0 1.1 Inversion of Control IoC DI</keywords>
  <topics>Frameworks, Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>CDI is available since EE6 and also with EE7 has evolved to version 1.1. CDI by many people is some kind of magic, though at the end it is only the assembly and usage of already known proxy features.

The workshop provides hands on experience from writing and assembling simple beans, and then step by step extending the capabilities until adding portable extensions. Also differences, between running in a standalone environment (JSR 330) and an EE container (JSR 299) will be shown. The workshop will also make use of some of the public available extension libraries such as Apache Deltaspike or JBoss Seam. Finally also usage of CDI along with EE7 batches is shown.

At the end each participant should be ready to dive into the low level details of CDI mechanisms and implementations.</abstract>

  <title>Enabling Real-time Queries to End-Users</title>
  <keywords>hadoop, realtime queries, lambda architecture</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Since it became an Apache Top Level Project in early 2008, Hadoop has established itself as the de-facto industry standard for batch processing. The two layers composing its core, HDFS and MapReduce, are strong building blocks for data processing. Running data analysis and crunching petabytes of data is no longer fiction. But the MapReduce framework does have two major drawbacks: query latency and data freshness. Enhancing the BigData stack with real time search capabilities is the next natural step for the Hadoop ecosystem.

This talk will try to answer the question of how to fill in this gap with specific open-source components, ultimately building a dedicated platform that will enable real-time queries on Internet-scale data sets.</abstract>

  <title>Come with an idea, go home with an app - hybrid apps development</title>
  <keywords>hybrid, mobile, web, hands-on</keywords>
  <topics>Mobile First/ Responsive Design/ UX, Frameworks, Native vs Web: Use Cases/ Tools/ Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>Facing all the many different approaches to creating hybrid apps, we decided to create a flexible and easy stack of technologies to help you turn your idea into performant apps faster.

This workshop will introduce you to the Lungo-Angular-Bridge and Phonegap and gives a hands-on approach, so that you can gain an understanding of all it needs to turn your idea into an app, using a hybrid stack built upon Angular, Lungo, HTML, CSS and Phonegap.

In the course of the workshop you will learn how to prototype, implement and deploy your app. You will also get insights into the available debugging and monitoring possibilities and how to integrate it with your CI workflow.

  <abstract>Many times we have seen enterprise-type applications built on enterprise technology stacks that are a slow and painful in development, testing and deployment. When we became part of the team tasked to build Switzerlands next generation interbank clearing system, we wanted to design it to be friendly to developers, testers and sysadmins alike.

In this session we share details on our design ideas centered around the fundamental decision to not rely on an application server and build our system as fully self-contained deployable units that are all Java SE applications managed by the sysadmins like any other application. </abstract>

  <title>Introduction to JSR 352 &quot;Java Batch&quot;</title>
  <keywords>JSR 352, Java Batch, JEE 7, Spring Batch</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>Batch processing is an often ignored and misunderstood domain in Java. The design and implementation rationale between “standard” Java EE online applications and batch jobs can seem confusing or contradictory. So far the flexible Spring Batch framework provided the best known solution for Java batch jobs.

With release of Java EE 7, batch processing was standardized and provided as a reference implementation based on the specification &quot;JSR 352 Java Batch”. The JSR rightly aligns closely to Spring Batch and also includes input of other Java batch solutions such as WebSphere XD.

This talk will introduce the JSR 352 and the core fundamentals of distributed batch processing and also highlight the requirements for large scale batch platforms.</abstract>

  <title>BigData and FastData - big and fast combined, how does it work?</title>
  <keywords>architecture, fastdata, bigdata</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Big Data (volume) and real-time information processing (velocity) are two important aspects of Big Data systems. At first sight, these two aspects seem to be incompatible. Are traditional software architectures still the right choice? Do we need new architectures?

The talk discusses the idea of the so-called lambda architecture, which acts on the assumption of a bisection of the data-processing: in a batch-phase a temporally bounded, large dataset is processed either through traditional ETL or MapReduce. In parallel, a real-time, online processing is constantly calculating the values of the new data coming in during the batch phase. The combination of the two results, batch and online processing is giving the constantly up-to-date view.</abstract>

  <abstract>Have you already asked yourself at the beginning of a SOA or Integration project about the technology you want to use? How and through which protocols do the systems to be integrated communicate? Is it a proprietary protocol or should a standard such as SOAP or RESTful web services be used? Is it feasible to implement the integration layer in Java or do modern integration platforms provide the important benefits to get closer to the often proposed IT flexibility and agility? Apart from answering other important questions we will also discuss service categorization and virtualization and present the advantages/disadvantages of a pure and programmatic Java-based approach compared to more declarative approach using BPEL, BPMN or an ESB.</abstract>

  <title>Kafka and Storm - event processing in realtime</title>
  <keywords>storm, kafka, fastdata, bigdata, java</keywords>
  <topics>Enterprise Java, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log. It is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime.

Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more.

This session presents the main concepts of Kafka and Storm and then shows how a simple stream processing application is implemented using these two technologies. </abstract>

  <abstract>Have you ever searched for an artifact in your local Nexus instance and wondered how did it get there ? what does it depend on ? what depends on it ? what is its parent module ? is it relying on the latest released components or just snapshots ?

What do you ship to your customers ? Binaries, that&#039;s right, and those are stored in your local repository manager; so you&#039;d better know how to extend it to make sure everyone in your organization gets the clearest picture about what it provides.

During this session, we&#039;ll get the audience familiar with some Nexus API (NexusAether, MavenBridge), how to extend features (Scheduled Tasks) and how to create nice tabs (based on ExtJS) to complete the Nexus UI with the information we care the most.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Hello Jazoon team,
With this talk, I want to share the experience we got developing Nexus plugins for our company, Terracotta, during &quot;innovation days&quot;.
With other colleagues, we had long discussions on how and where to implement tooling that would provide developers, QAs, PMs a nice web based UI (using mvn versions:display-dependency-updates on the command line is not always an option ;-) ) giving the maximum information about a maven artifact in a snap.
We think we made the right choice choosing nexus plugins, and we&#039;ll give common pitfalls and best practices to get the audience started on how to develop nexus plugins !
The plugins we created and worked on are shared on github :
https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/nexus-dependency-management-plugin
https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/properties-metadata-maven-plugin
https://github.com/saleemshafi/nexus-artifact-usage-plugin (we are just contributors on that one)</paper_external_comment>

  <title>JavaFX/JacpFX interaction with JSR 356 WebSockets</title>
  <keywords>JavaFX, JacpFX, WebSockets, JSR 356, GlassFish 4</keywords>
  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>JSR 356 WebSockets are one of the new exciting features of JEE 7 and it includes a Server- as well as a Client API as part of its reference implementation. This makes it well suited to integrate it with JavaFX on client side.

JacpFX is a RCP framework on top of JavaFX, which uses a message-based approach to interact with components. This approach makes it easy to integrate WebSocket-ClientEndpoints and to pass incoming WebSocket messages to your JacpFX components.

Besides the integration scenario with JacpFX this session will show how to create ServerEndpoints on GlassFish 4 and, how to integrate ClientEndpoints directly with plain JavaFX.

  <title>Deploying trusted developer sandboxes in Amazon&#039;s cloud</title>
  <keywords>Amazon, security, big data</keywords>
  <topics>Collaboration Tools, DevOps, Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>As Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in the cloud become more compelling, new collaboration possibilities emerge. A large European agency wished to offer vast satellite imagery free of charge to users who develop good applications for it. Instead of sending data to developers, why not offer a dev environment in the cloud?

This talk describes an automated trusted remote Java development sandbox hosted in the Amazon cloud that uses strong encryption for system authentication and file system services, Security-conscious users can trust that their application intellectual property won&#039;t be leaked while trusting neither the cloud provider nor the operators who deploy and maintain the cloud-based sandbox service running on top of it.</abstract>

  <title>A Survey of Open Source Cross Platform Cloud APIs</title>
  <keywords>Cloud, IaaS</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>Among the most cited reasons against the adoption of cloud computing services is the well-founded fear of lock-in. There is a large amount of effort needed to move critical business functions to the cloud and integrate cloud services into internal processes. Once this has been done, inertia makes it difficult to change yet again if the result is unsatisfactory.

Some solutions implement the market leader&#039;s API while others offer translation services as middleware.

In this talk, we survey open source cross platform cloud APIs, describing benefits and caveats for their use in different contexts and suggest evaluation criteria your organization can use for potentially choosing one over the other for a given cloud adoption business case.</abstract>

  <title>Evaluating IaaS Cloud Providers</title>
  <keywords>Cloud, IaaS</keywords>
  <topics>Cloud/ BigData</topics>
  <abstract>The cloud computing market has produced a large choice of providers. It is notoriously difficult to establish objective evaluation criteria for selecting one provider over another. Gartner once famously tried to compare enterprise cloud providers such as Verizon Business with &quot;pure cloud&quot; providers such as Amazon&#039;s AWS in their magic quadrant report.

This talk limits itself to the evaluation of &quot;pure cloud&quot; infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers. You will learn about attributes such as data jurisdiction, process conformance, ease of extraction, etc that are available for comparison among dozens of providers as well as hints on how one can use such results. Finally a process is proposed for adapting such evaluation criteria over time.</abstract>

  <title>Enabling Real-time Queries for End-Users</title>
  <keywords>Hadoop, Big Data, open source, </keywords>
  <topics />
  <abstract>Enhancing the BigData stack with real time search capabilities is the next natural step for the Hadoop ecosystem, because the MapReduce framework was not designed with synchronous processing in mind. This talk will answer the question of how to fill in this gap with specific open-source components, ultimately building a dedicated platform that will enable real-time queries on Internet-scale data sets. After discussing the evolution of common Hadoop platform deployments, a hybrid approach called lambda architecture will be proposed. It will be demonstrated with concrete examples, discussing which technology could be a good match and how they would interact together.</abstract>

  <abstract>Very close collaboration in a software team is a key success factor in agile software development. However, the practices of collaborating are quite divers and there are still open questions as to which of them bring up better results.

In a follow-up project of the Swiss Agile Study 2012, we interviewed several IT companies of different sizes and branches, with the focus on communication, collaboration and cooperation within the team and with the outside world,. In this talk we provide an overview about current best-practices of collaboration in agile teams, including the extra challenges raised by distributed teams. We will cover typical organizational and methodical approaches of successful agile teams and the tools of choice used.</abstract>

  <title>Getting a client advisory plattform ready for the tablet: SPA, UX design &amp; lessons learned</title>
  <keywords>ux design, phonegap, tablet, online/offline</keywords>
  <topics>Mobile First/ Responsive Design/ UX, Native vs Web: Use Cases/ Tools/ Best Practices, Browser limits and beyond</topics>
  <abstract>When Steve Jobs presented the iPad in 2010 it became clear, that such devices would soon become integral part of client advisory in banking and insurance. We already had an extensive integrated advisory platform for the desktop, following a typical web approach on the Java stack. When we started developing a tablet frontend as a complementary channel we knew, that mobile usage and the touch interface would require an entirely different application design. To do it right, however, took a long way on a rugged road.

In this talk we give an overview about the pitfalls we ran into. We show how UX design, mobile first, and a hybrid Phonegap / Backbone approach lead us to a cross-platform online-offline app comparable to native counterparts.

  <keywords>JavaScript, build tools, development cycle, backbone, grunt, node, tomcat</keywords>
  <topics>Frameworks, JS Build/ Testing/ Coverage, Native vs Web: Use Cases/ Tools/ Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>HTML/CSS/Javascript is often adopted for cross-platform mobile development. For deep integration (file storage, camera access, etc.) a native wrapper such as Phonegap is required. The backend is typically accessed through a REST API.

Getting development started in such an environment can be challenging.

In this talk we present a setup suitable for developing hybrid single page online-offline apps. Spring MVC is used for implementing the REST API. The mobile client uses Backbone/Thorax, Bootstrap, and jQuery mobile, wrapped in Phonegap for deployment on different mobile platforms. We show how maven, grunt and X-code can be setup for efficient development, including unittesting, debugging, modularity, and clean code.</abstract>

  <abstract>It sounds so great, yet so familiar: Write once, deploy everywhere.

Rings a bell, eh?

Hybrid mobile apps are great: Take your web technology stack, either HTML/CSS/JS or only Javascript, sprinkle access to native APIs into it and shrinkwrap it into a &quot;native&quot; application container, ready to go on all the app stores! What a wonderful thing.

But it isn&#039;t always fun and games...

and that&#039;s what this talk is about:
- Why &quot;web&quot; isn&#039;t always the same
- Making great UIs is more than just pretty icons and buttons and stuff
- On Performance and Psychology
- Testing, Debugging and almost-deadly blood pressure</abstract>

  <topics>Java (JSE/ JEE), Scala, Enterprise Java</topics>
  <abstract>Domain model is base of every enterprise application. We all know at least a bit of how to design the right entities to cope with the problem in hand. But how to model the domain the functional way, where you prefer immutability, functions and their composability? What are the benefits and drawbacks of such an approach? In this talk I discus application of functional programming and its abstractions in domain modelling. I show it on the example without complicated theory behind. I touch slightly also technical problems, how to store, load and work with such a models with standard set of JEE frameworks. FP gains its interest in last years and its importance is even expected to raise with Java 8.</abstract>
