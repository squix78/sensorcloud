  <title>HTTP services: a practical guide for having stateless fun</title>
  <keywords>HTTP, REST</keywords>
  <topics>2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc), 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>When building web applications we are basically bound to a single protocol, the HTTP one.

The web, the largest REST architecture ever, has proven how scalability can be reached with this simple but powerful hypertext protocol, but many developers tend to think HTTP as a mere tunnel for exposing resources on the web.

In this short session we will see how to practically leverage a few key aspects of a web architecture:

* caching resources and fragments with ESI and HInclude

* implementing high-avaibility on suffering systems

* using auto-discovery to build affordable and durable webservices

* sessions in a session-less scenario

All of these thanks to HTTP.</abstract>

  <title>Categorization of Web Frameworks for the Java Platform</title>
  <keywords>web-framework, java, jsf, gwt, javafx, grails</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 2.2. RIA Frameworks, Java or JavaScript based, 2.3. RIA and the Web Architecture</topics>
  <abstract>The Java platform comprises an unmanageable number of web frameworks such as JSF, Wicket, Tapestry, GWT, ZK, JavaFX, Grails and Lift. It is very difficult to decide when to use which web framework. But without choosing the right framework, it is hard to fulfil the technical requirements of a web application, and to ensure long-term success regarding productivity and maintenance costs.

This session categorizes the different web frameworks and points out possible application fields. It is intended to give a general overview without going into too much technical detail.

At first, the most important design concepts regarding web development are explained. Afterwards, the most important web frameworks for the Java platform are described and categorized. Some realistic uses cases in daily business are presented to explain why some categories are better suited for specific requirements than other ones. Finally, the listener is able to decide what category best fits the requirements of a specific project.

Target Audience: Project Managers, Software Architects, Software Developers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites required of attendees: Only basic knowledge of Java and web technologies such as HTML

  <title>Lessons learned: Usage of modern JVM Languages besides Java</title>
  <keywords>Java, Groovy, Scala, Clojure, JRuby</keywords>
  <topics>3.6. JavaScript On The Server, Node.js, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 7.3. JRuby, Groovy, scripting and other languages on the Java VM, 7.4. Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages</topics>
  <abstract>Java is the main language for the JVM, but it has several shortcomings which cannot be solved in future releases such as Java 7 or 8 due to the requirement of backward compatibility. In the last years, several modern languages such as Clojure, Jython, JRuby, Groovy and Scala emerged for the JVM besides the almighty Java to improve the programming experience.

This progress report shows which modern languages we use in our projects besides Java and why we use them. The main goal is to provide information about the business value of introducing additional languages. Nevertheless, some code examples will be shown, too.

The session shows several advantages of these languages and why a few of them should be considered at least in some parts of many projects. Of course, some non-negligible problems have to be solved when introducing new JVM languages besides Java. This sessions also describes these problems and gives hints how to solve them.

  <title>Spoilt for Choice: Which Integration Framework to use – Apache Camel, Spring Integration or Mule?</title>
  <keywords>egIntegration Framework, Apache Camel, Mule ESB, Spring Intration, ESB</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.4. Real-Time Processing, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages</topics>
  <abstract>Data exchanges between companies increase a lot. The number of applications which must be integrated increases, too. The interfaces use different technologies, protocols and data formats. Nevertheless, the integration of these applications shall be modeled in a standardized way, realized efficiently and supported by automatic tests.

Three integration frameworks are available in the JVM environment, which fulfil these requirements: Apache Camel, Spring Integration und Mule. They implement the well-known Enteprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and therefore offers a standardized, domain-specific language to integrate applications.

These Integration Frameworks can be used in almost every integration project within the JVM environment - no matter which technologies, transport protocols or data formats are used. All integration projects can be realized in a consistent way without redundant boilerplate code.

This session shows and compares the three alternatives and discusses their pros and cons. Besides, a recommendation will be given when to use a more powerful Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) instead of one of these frameworks.

Target Audience: Project Managers, Software Architects, Software Developers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites required of attendees: Only basic knowledge of Java and XML.

  <title>Next Generation – Systems Integration in Cloud Era</title>
  <keywords>Cloud Computing, Apache Camel, Integration Framework. PaaS, IaaS</keywords>

  <abstract>Cloud Computing is the future! Nevertheless, everybody should be aware that there won’t be one single cloud solution, but several clouds. These clouds will be hosted at different providers, use different deployment models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and use products, technologies and APIs from different vendors. Thus, in the future you will have to integrate these clouds as you integrate applications today. The open source integration framework Apache Camel is already prepared for this challenging task.

Apache Camel implements the well-known Enteprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and therefore offers a standardized, domain-specific language to integrate applications and clouds. The efficiency is even more increased through the use of the modern JVM languages such as Groovy or Scala. It can be used in almost every integration project within the JVM environment. All integration projects can be realized in a consistent way without redundant boilerplate code. Even automatic testing is supported.

This session demonstrates the elegance of Apache Camel for cloud integration. Several examples are shown for all deployment models by integrating cloud services from Amazon Web Services (IaaS), Google App Engine (PaaS), salesforce.com (SaaS), and others.

If the required cloud service is not supported by Apache Camel, you can easily create your own Camel component with very low effort. This procedure is explained at the end of the session.

Target Audience: Project Managers, Software Architects, Software Developers

Level: Intermediate.

Prerequisites required of attendees: Basic knowledge of Java and Cloud Computing concepts.

  <title>Systems Integration in the Multi-Core Era with Apache Camel and Akka</title>
  <keywords>Akka, Apache Camel, Actors, Concurrency, Systems Integration</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.4. Real-Time Processing, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 7.4. Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>Concurrency increases performance of most applications. Due to multi core processors it is indispensable in the future. Java already offers a solution since the beginning: The Thread-API. It works, but is too complex because it uses low-level concepts such as locks and synchronization. Debugging and monitoring is very tough. Race conditions and deadlocks are the consequence.

A paradigm change is upcoming: Actors – a concept which already exists for a long time in languages such as Erlang – is implicitly supported by modern JVM languages. Actors reduce the complexity of concurrent programming a lot. Just two things are required: Rethinking when designing concurrent applications and learning the lightweight, simple Actor-API. Go away from locks, wait, and notifies to immutable, asynchronous messaging and begin to have fun when developing concurrent applications with Java or Scala using the Akka framework.

Unfortunately, using Actors is not always an option - especially if several systems have to be integrated. Existing applications often do not offer an API for JVM languages. Instead, technologies such as low-level TCP, data transfer with FTP or SOAP Web Services have to be used. The akka-camel module of Akka offers an additional integration layer which solves this problem. Exchanging messages between actors and other protocols is almost trivial using the easy-to-use, but very powerful integration framework Apache Camel.

This sessions shows the combination of Akka and Apache Camel. The audience learns how to integrate almost every technology into a concurrent, distributed actor-based application in a very simple way.

Target Audience: Project Managers, Software Architects, Software Developers

Level: Intermediate.

Prerequisites required of attendees: Basic knowledge of Java or Scala and distributed concepts.

  <title>Business Process Management beyond Web Services</title>
  <keywords>BPM, Activit, Apache Camel, Systems Integration, BPMN</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.3. BPM, 5.4. Real-Time Processing</topics>
  <abstract>Business Process Management (BPM) is an emerging approach to optimize business processes and increase efficiency. Today, interfaces are usually specified through Web Service standards such as WS-BPEL. The limitation is unflexible and insufficient.

This session shows a live demo about the powerful combination of two open source products: Activiti for BPM and the integration framework Apache Camel. This combination allows to model and realize BPM. While the model and execution is based on the new BPMN 2.0 standard, the integration of every imaginable technology besides Web Services, such as JMS, actors, cloud services, and about 100 more, is supported by Apache Camel. Even automatic testing is included. BPM was never that cheap and easy to realize in the JVM environment.

Activiti also supports two other open source integration frameworks as alternative to Apache Camel: Spring Integration and Mule ESB. Pros and cons of all three alternatives will be discussed at the end of the session.

Target Audience: Project Managers, Software Architects, Software Developers

Level: Intermediate.

  <title>Big boys play Java with Lego, leJOS and Android</title>
  <keywords>android lego mindstorms lejos fun</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Android Development, 4.5. Hardware related features (NFC, etc.), 8.2. Experiments, 8.3. Entertainment, Gaming</topics>
  <abstract>During this talk I would like to show a combination of our beloved Java and the well known Lego bricks. Including some small motors and a few sensors, the Lego Mindstorms kit makes it possible to build various robots from Technic bricks, control them using the motors and make them interact with the outside world through the light, sound and distance sensors.

The robots can then be programmed using the open-source leJOS library, which consists of a mobile virtual machine (to replace Mindstorms&#039; original firmware) and a set of classes which make access to the hardware really simple.

Additionaly, the talk covers some basic topics related to developing on the Android platform, particularly the use of Bluetooth and motion sensors. The above combined let us build a simple robot remotely controlled with an Android phone.

The talk is going to have a theoretical part, during which I would like to introduce the basics of leJOS and Android development, and give a brief overview of the remote control application and the robot software. This is then going to be followed with a live demo showing the robot in action. I&#039;m sure the talk will give you a pleasant break from your day-to-day Java tasks.</abstract>

  <topics>5.4. Real-Time Processing, 7.4. Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>The topic of this presentation is about demonstrating how combination of Scala and GridGain software allows to build a real time big data processing application in a record time and how GridGain’s approach is different to the one employed by Hadoop framework that is based on offline batch-oriented processing.

Most of the presentation will be concentrate on the live “from scratch” coding of the application that takes an ubiquities Hadoop example of calculating word frequencies in the large body of text and implementing it using GridGain to work in 100% real time context instead.

The live coding part of the presentation will be done using Scala programming language that is natively supported by GridGain&#039;s Scala-based DSL.

The initial 10 minutes of the presentation will be devoted to explaining the big data concepts and high level explanation about GridGain and Hadoop approaches to solving it.

Overall - the presentation is extremely hands-on and require significant level of understanding of Java or Scala and basic level of understanding for distributed programming concepts such as In-Memory Data Grid and Compute Grids.</abstract>

  <keywords>Regular Expressions, Production , Log Files</keywords>
  <topics>7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>As an IT operations staff for more than a decade now, Some things are a must to know in a world of IT operations.

IT operations area is full of long boring and dull log files. Going through theses files on regular bases could be dull and boring job. Many attempts where made to use normal text manipulation functions in differnt languages just to scan and collect valuable information from operations log files.

Regular Expressions (RE) where found to be a very handy and useful skill in such environments, just like SQL, bash and wsh scripting:

This presentation is focused on the following points:

1) Making IT Operations staff appreciate the Skill of Regular expressions just like they appreciate SQL and shell scripting.

2) Sharing experiences about applications of RE (Reports, Reconciliation Report formats and health checks).

3) Introducing RE in a gradual manner for beginners till it reaches the advanced level and breaking the entry barrier for all environments.

The slides I intend to use, are available at my blog:

http://blog.maksoft.ch/2010/10/02/regular-expressions-in-100-minutes/

Of course I will have to modify the slides to match the time-frame of 50 Minuites.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Ever been in a situation where you are:

•Looking for a needle in a haystack ?
•Looking for a certain tree in the forest?
IT professionals are in such situations all the time when it comes to LOG files.

LOG files in this business are everywhere, in development, in testing and especially in production. You keep looking for error message and extract performance statistics from LOG files !

Well Regular Expressions is there to help you find your needle or tree.  It is a unique way to find TEXT PATTERNS in single lines or paragraphs.

This tutorial is a quick learning startup fo Regular Expressions (RE).

The slides in this Tutorial are prepared with certain considerations in Mind:

1.They can be used as a tutorial for yourself and your colleagues in around 100 minutes .
2.They could serve as a desktop quick guide for Regualr expressions.

  <topics>3.1.  Java &amp; JavaScript, 3.5. JavaScript Frameworks, Tools, Libraries, 7.9. .net, C#, .net languages &amp; technologies</topics>
  <abstract>With Windows 8 Microsoft will introduce a new technology for developing apps on their platform: WinRT - the Windows Runtime. WinRT bridges the gap between the Windows 8 operating system&#039;s SDK and higher level languages like C#, VB or even JavaScript. Microsoft&#039;s goal is to make developing Windows 8 metro-style apps with HTML5 and JavaScript feel natural to people familiar with these web technologies. This session is especially for web developers who want to learn how they can build upon their existing knowledge to create apps for Microsoft&#039;s coming new operating system and market place.

In his session Rainer Stropek starts with a short overview about WinRT. He introduces the WinRT architecture and talks the functionality it offers. Based on this information Rainer demonstrates how Microsoft&#039;s &quot;Chakra&quot; JavaScript engine projects WinRT into the JavaScript language. He will show how to consume existing functionality from WinRT’s library to e.g. access the underlying hardware of the Windows 8 tablet PC. In a second step Rainer will extend the sample by creating a custom WinRT component in C++ and consuming it in JavaScript.</abstract>

  <title>Vaadin, Rich Web Apps in Server-Side Java without Plug-ins or JavaScript</title>
  <keywords>Vaadin, Java, RIA, Web, HTML5</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 2.2. RIA Frameworks, Java or JavaScript based, 2.3. RIA and the Web Architecture</topics>
  <abstract>Get introduced to the Vaadin framework by one of its core developers. The Vaadin provides a desktop-like programming model on the server for creating Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) in plain Java - without the need for HTML, XML, plug-ins or JavaScript.

In this session, Joonas lays out the key concepts of the server-side RIA development model and compares it to client-side RIA. To demonstrate the use of framework, an example application is developed during the session step-by-step. The presentation is concluded with pointers on how to start developing your own applications with Apache-licensed Vaadin-framework.

You&#039;ll learn:

  <abstract_plain>Get introduced to the Vaadin framework by one of its core developers. The Vaadin provides a desktop-like programming model on the server for creating Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) in plain Java - without the need for HTML, XML, plug-ins or JavaScript.

In this session, Joonas lays out the key concepts of the server-side RIA development model and compares it to client-side RIA. To demonstrate the use of framework, an example application is developed during the session step-by-step. The presentation is concluded with pointers on how to start developing your own applications with Apache-licensed Vaadin-framework.

You&#039;ll learn:

* How to create a desktop like web application in Java

* Difference between page oriented, client-side RIA and server-side RIA architectures

* How Vaadin can be extended with Google Web Toolkit

  <abstract>RAM is becoming cheaper and cheaper, and it&#039;s not unusual to see 100+GB of RAM in a single production server. Coupled with SOA, applications tend to have more and more data located in caches, which are allocated in RAM. But having so much data in the managed memory of the JVM (the heap) tends to have a nasty drawback: Garbage Collection (GC)! The longer the GC takes to collect the memory, the longer your application becomes unresponsive.

That&#039;s why a &quot;new&quot; battle host for JVM performance tuning is now emerging: allocating memory outside of the managed segments, called off­heap memory. Terracotta BigMemory, Hadoop, Cassandra and Lucene have all adopted this approach.

The Apache Foundation has also seen the creation of a new project implementing this technology, namely DirectMemory. Sill in the incubation phase, DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring off­ heap memory storage (a­la BigMemory) to enable caching of Java objects without degrading JVM performance.</abstract>

  <title>Tracing Requirements with the Eclipse Requirements Modeling Framework</title>
  <keywords>RMF, Eclipse, Traceability, Requirements, Modeling</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages</topics>
  <abstract>No matter whether a heavy-weight approach like RUP is employed or an agile one - requirements have to be collected and organized somehow. It is desirable to maintain the requirements and to establish a traceability between the requirements and the development artifacts. Such a traceability has many uses, including to support project management, testing or change management, to name just a few.

In practice, it is difficult to find the right balance for requirements management: If requirements are not updated, their usefulness is severely limited. Likewise, an incomplete or incorrect traceability can be worse than having none at all. The cost of a correctly maintained traceability can in some circumstances out-weight their value.

In this talk, we present the Eclipse Requirements Modeling Framework (RMF) and its GUI, ProR. RMF supports a generic data model that is based on the emerging ReqIF standard. ReqIF is an OMG standard that was developed by the automotive industry to aid the exchange of requirements between manufacturers and suppliers. ProR is the first clean-room implementation of a ReqIF tool. We expect most industry tools to support ReqIF by the end of 2012 (many tools, including Rational DOORS, already support the predecessor of ReqIF). Support for the project was pledged by Airbus, Thales, MKS and many others (see http://eclipse.org/rmf).

As ProR is generic, it can be used with a wide range of development processes. But the real power stems from the ability to extend it with plugins to provide additional functionality. In this talk, we will also present a method for building a formal model of requirements. The method supports the iterative addition of requirements to the model, while evolving the requirements. We demonstrate how ProR (with the integration plugin) support tasks like link creation, change management and requirements evolution.

As an Eclipse project, RMF can easily be integrated into existing tools. There is a lot of interest in the Topcased community, for instance, to integrate ProR for better requirements engineering support. Further, we are evaluating traceability support for SysML, implemented in Topcased.

This talk addresses everybody who manages requirements and who deals with the software development process. Besides requirements engineers, this includes product managers, project managers and software architects. As systems being developed are getting more and more complex, the importance of an effective development process and an integrated tool chain are becoming increasingly important. RMF makes an open contribution in an area that so far has been under-represented in the Eclipse ecosystem.

  <title>Next generation app development using jQuery mobile</title>
  <keywords>jQuery mobile, App development, PhoneGap, iOS, Javascript</keywords>
  <topics>3.4. jQuery, jQuery Mobile, 4.2. iOS Development</topics>
  <abstract>Mobile application development has been focused on native programming languages. This means in the case of iPhone and iPad learning objective-c as well as new interfaces and APIs. With the ability of today’s mobile device browsers, HTML5 and frameworks like jQuery mobile and PhoneGap completely new possibilities of application development arise.

The first part of the presentation gives an insight into jQuery mobile based on a simple iPhone gaming app. The goal is to show how mobile apps using jQuery mobile can be developed. Furthermore the possibilities of reuse of existing Javascript code will be addressed.

The second part of the presentation focuses on more complex applications. Different Javascript frameworks like Backbone, Knockout or AngularJS bring Javascript MVC approaches on the mobile device. This includes also the interaction between client and server side. Along a short example the main pitfalls of the coexistence between jQuery mobile and those Frameworks will be shown.

The final part of the presentation will show the difference between offline HTML5 development and real mobile device app development. Using the PhoneGap framework a five minutes app deployment of a jQuery mobile application will be demonstrated. This part addresses the main differences between these development and deployment methods as well as the access of native functionality like camera or mail. It touches on some of the existing PhoneGap plugins.

Along the presentation the main resources in the web will be listed. After this talk each participant will able to write its own iPhone and Android app in just a couple of hours.

Why to attend:

The presentation gives a practical insight into jQuery mobile application development and deployment to mobile devices. Using many examples at the end of the presentation the audience will be able to develop their own mobile applications. The talk will give an introduction for beginners as well as further information for experienced developers.

  <abstract>NoSQL has garnered tremendous attention in recent years as the basis of

architectures for building large linearly scalable systems. As a document oriented database, Couchbase Server presents the user with a simple approach to storing and retrieving data across a cluster.

Couchbase Server 2.0 has rich querying capabilities of the distributed database through views built atop an always updating incremental map-reduce. Accessing Couchbase Server is also very easy, as there are client SDKs for Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby and many other common languages. Couchbase Server builds upon Apache CouchDB and Memcached.

Attend this session for a very quick overview of Couchbase NoSQL, the

ecosystem and what it means to Java developers and implementers. We will

demonstrate with liberal code examples of how to use the Java APIs on Couchbase to drive home some of these concepts. Building on very simple operations it&#039;s possible to build fairly sophisticated applications.</abstract>

  <title>OSGi and the Enterprise: A match made in … a box?</title>
  <keywords>OSGi, open source, enterprise</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>As the dynamic modularity technology for Java, OSGi has been heavily used *inside* Enterprise Java runtimes for many years. With the release in 2010 of the OSGi 4.2 Enterprise specification and open source implementations in Apache and Eclipse, there is momentum gathering on the use of OSGi by enterprise applications.

The Apache Aries project is an open source implementation of this standard. It is designed to complement existing web servers with a new set of pluggable enterprise-level services such as transactions, persistence, service bindings, and dependency injection. The Blueprint container standardizes the popular Spring component model, enabling dependency injection, application component assembly, and allowing beans to be easily swapped in and out for unit testing. Integration with JPA and JNDI standards allow declarative persistence and interoperability with legacy applications. Support for transactions and JMX provide enterprise-level application control.

This session will present a overview of the Apache Aries project and give an end-to-end demonstration of how a simple - but useful - Aries Application can be assembled from web, persistence and Blueprint components and then dynamically deployed.</abstract>
  <abstract_plain>As the dynamic modularity technology for Java, OSGi has been heavily used *inside* Enterprise Java runtimes for many years. With the release in 2010 of the OSGi 4.2 Enterprise specification and open source implementations in Apache and Eclipse, there is momentum gathering on the use of OSGi by enterprise applications.

The Apache Aries project is an open source implementation of this standard. It is designed to complement existing web servers with a new set of pluggable enterprise-level services such as transactions, persistence, service bindings, and dependency injection. The Blueprint container standardizes the popular Spring component model, enabling dependency injection, application component assembly, and allowing beans to be easily swapped in and out for unit testing. Integration with JPA and JNDI standards allow declarative persistence and interoperability with legacy applications. Support for transactions and JMX provide enterprise-level application control.

This session will present a overview of the Apache Aries project and give an end-to-end demonstration of how a simple - but useful - Aries Application can be assembled from web, persistence and Blueprint components and then dynamically deployed.</abstract_plain>

  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.3. BPM, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages</topics>
  <abstract>When we think about software development we almost automatically think in terms of imperative programming. Despite is not a new idea, only in recent years functional programming is gaining more traction, mostly because it makes easier the development of heavily parallel programs. Nevertheless there&#039;s a third paradigm that, especially for some specific categories of problems, represents the most natural, flexible and maintainable solution: declarative programming. After a brief introduction to declarative programming and rule engines, showing how they work and in which circumstances they should be used, the talk will illustrate how these concepts have been implemented in Drools and which tools the Drools ecosystems provides making it a complete and effective Business Logic Integration Platform.</abstract>

  <title>Real world DSL: making developers and business people speaking the same language</title>
  <keywords>DSL, fluent interface, Scala, functional programming</keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 7.4. Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc)</topics>
  <abstract>One of the biggest causes of failures in many IT projects are misunderstandings between business analysts and developers. This issue could be solved, or at least widely mitigated, by writing the business part of our software with a proper DSL. Indeed to express the business rules with the jargon, typical of the domain we are trying to model with our application, allows the analysts to understand and validate those rules directly for how they have been encoded.

The main goal of the talk is to show some techniques and give some hints to design and implement effective and readable DSLs. The most important patterns that can be helpful for DSL implementation will be explained with many practical examples in Java. Similar examples will be also presented in Scala showing how both functional programming in general and some more specific language&#039;s features, like curry and implicits, can improve the DSL conciseness and readability making a valid Scala statement extremely similar to a plain English sentence.</abstract>

  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 7.3. JRuby, Groovy, scripting and other languages on the Java VM</topics>
  <abstract>When Grails was first released, it brought the benefits of frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django to the Java platform. Built on such industry heavyweights as Spring and Hibernate, it allows you to rapidly build web applications while still giving you access to the underlying libraries when you need that level of control.

Version 2.0 introduces many improvements such as an interactive console with command completion, more data stores that you can access via its ORM, and even better support for testing. Find out more about all the new features and see some of these in action with a live demo.

  <keywords>nosql, grails, prototyping</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Most web applications have traditionally been backed by a relational database of some sort, but new types of data store are coming into fashion: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and more. These are designed to tackle different sets of problems and all of them have different APIs and work very differently underneath.

This talk will show you how the ORM layer in Grails (GORM) provides a consistent API for all supported data stores, allowing you to quickly try different ones out. You&#039;ll also see how a simple domain model maps to a few of the more common data stores, giving you an insight into their internal models.</abstract>

  <abstract>There is a lot of hype around HTML5, but is HTML5 really the future of the web. Companies like Google, Adobe and even Microsoft are going the HTML5 route and stopping development on Silverlight and Flash Mobile in favor of HTML5 standards. Now HTML5 is not done yet, but there are a lot of advantages in using it, especially when developing for mobile. In this presentation I&#039;m going to show some examples how HTML5 when used as a Mobile development platform can make for platform independence. I&#039;ll show some examples and talk about some of the frameworks that people can use to get started building the applications of tomorrow. There will be some live coding during this session to give an idea of how easy it can be to use the latest HTML5 standards to create a small game</abstract>

  <title>Large business apps: key success factors in automated migration to Java/Linux</title>
  <keywords>linux java migration mainframe</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.3. BPM</topics>
  <abstract>Many large corporations are currently willing to migrate their large business-critical applications to Open Source, specifically Java &amp; Linux. Modernization toward a state-of-the-art system as well as massive savings are the objectives of such projects.

Through various projects, including one of renown private bank in Geneva (currently migrating its core banking system of 10+ millions lines Cobol), we&#039;ll give concrete facts &amp; figures about those objectives.

In parallel, we&#039;ll present the key success factors as well as the methodology to be used in such projects to achieve success, meet the goals (duration, costs) at minimum risk (« no big bang ») :

1) setup of an industrial repeatable process for transcoding to Java rather than « 1-shot » trials

2) recurring use of automated testing tools

3) live and coherent sharing of business database by old and new system

4) iso-functionality of new system compared to old one.

Precise figures on savings and productivity / functional gains when moving to Open Source will be disclosed. Also, the possibility of creating massive added-value : automated generation of an SOA as basis of the deployment of global BPM solution will be exposed

This presentation will demonstrate that it is possible for large corporations to preserve their very large software investments of previous decades when achieving at the same time massive savings and leveraging vast modernization offered by Java on Linux.</abstract>

  <title>How did DSDM Atern Help Create Teamwork, Quality, Innovation, Enjoyment &amp; Pride</title>
  <keywords>Agile, DSDM, Atern, Technical Debt, Estimating, Agile Project Management, Quality, Testing, Support, Management</keywords>
  <topics>9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches</topics>
  <abstract>The adoption of the Agile method DSDM Atern at a Swiss software house, improved delivery beyond expectations. However, it was in leveraging the framework that provided even greater results. It enabled the company to address estimation and technical debt. This allowed the teams to focus resulting in the business extracting more productivity from scarce highly qualified resources.

The results included measurably improved software quality and demonstrably improved teamwork and so provided the basis for enabling innovation whilst all being done in an environment of enjoyment and pride.

As we tell the story, we will be asking the following questions and supporting the answers with quantified evidence and real-world examples.

1. Why did Infonic adopt the Agile method DSDM Atern, as opposed to Scrum which is far more widely used?

2. During estimating workshops, what techniques were used to successfully push-back on Management, as they always wanted to influence the estimates?

3. How did the company organize time to focus on new functionality yet also have dedicated time to reduce technical debt and improve the development environment thus releasing fresh energy and motivation for each new release?

4. How was the MoSCoW technique used to organize the entire organization so that the company as a whole tested at key times and eliminated gaps in automated test coverage (another form of technical debt)?

5. How did general Agile techniques raise the profile and acceptance of Quality Control (testing) and Support whilst also reducing the ‘prima-donna’ affect such that no team-member was left behind?

All of this resulted in the following, within a period of 12-18 months:

• 40% more Teamwork

• 40% more Quality

• 40% more Enjoyment

• 50% more Innovation

• 76% Less critical defects during acceptance testing

• 90% preference for the company vs competition

• 100% satisfied clients

  <title>10 Best Practices for Managing Remote Employees</title>
  <keywords>remote employees,outsourcing,remote management</keywords>
  <topics>9.3. Involving HR/personal management</topics>
  <abstract>These days companies and individuals tend to hire remote employees and outsource various tasks even more. We do this because in this way we pay less, we can hire professionals from other countries without paying for relocation, instead of staying in office we work with people using email. As a result we can improve our own life style spending more time with family and travelling.

For sure, there are certain risks when you work with people that you don&#039;t know in person. All the processes are a little bit different and something looks like a risky deal. But it is not!

In this talk we will discuss top 10 practices for managing remote employees. You will learn the specific of finding remote employee, communication, task setting and controlling, finance, building long-term relationship.

These who already work with remote employee will find in this talk ready to use ideas to make the process even better by cutting costs and decreasing management efforts.</abstract>

  <abstract>Today it&#039;s easy to expose services as REST/HTTP with frameworks like Jersey and Spring but validating that the server response actually looks like intended can be cumbersome in Java. REST Assured is an open source Java DSL that allows you to avoid boiler-plate code to make requests and validate even complex responses in a simple manner. Come and see how easily you can validate XML or JSON responses by making use of Groovy data structures and closures from Java. It also comes with support for popular authentication schemes, simple file uploading, flawless integration with JUnit and TestNG and much more.

  <abstract>Today it&#039;s easy to expose services as REST/HTTP with frameworks like Jersey and Spring but validating that the server response actually looks like intended can be cumbersome in Java. REST Assured is an open source Java DSL that allows you to avoid boiler-plate code to make requests and validate even complex responses in a simple manner. Come and see how easily you can validate XML or JSON responses by making use of Groovy data structures and closures from Java. It also comes with support for popular authentication schemes, simple file uploading, flawless integration with JUnit and TestNG and much more. Testing and verifying REST services in Java cannot be much simpler!</abstract>

  <abstract>Testing asynchronous systems is hard. Not only does it require handling threads, timeouts and concurrency issues, but the intent of the test code can be obscured by all these details. Awaitility is a small Java based DSL that allows you to express expectations of an asynchronous system in a concise and easy to read manner. Come and see how easily fragile time consuming tests can be transformed into its more robust and elegant counterpart.</abstract>

  <keywords>javafx, jclouds, scala, scalafx, cloud</keywords>
  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 2.2. RIA Frameworks, Java or JavaScript based, 2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 7.4. Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages</topics>
  <abstract>What do you get when you combine JavaFX and Scala together on top of a Cloud architecture? The most highly scalable platform for Java client development possible, leveraging the UI richness of JavaFX, elegance of Scala, and infinite scalability of a multi-cloud platform.

In this talk we will demonstrate a cloud application built on the JClouds platform that makes use of a JavaFX front-end written in the Scala language. This is an ideal platform for cost-efficient cloud use, since JavaFX technology lets your client&#039;s processor and GPU do the heavy-lifting while you maintain a lightweight set of REST APIs in the cloud.

We will go into background on multi-cloud deployment, writing effective REST services, and building rich user interfaces. Since these all share a common foundation on the Java platform, you will learn to easily write end-to-end applications leveraging your existing development knowledge and platform. Also, all the technologies showcased are 100% open-source, so you can start using these at your job today.

Come join us for a fun, informative talk on application development for the cloud. By the end of the session you will have learned to build an end-to-end client cloud application from the ground up and have access to the source code as a starting point for your own projects.</abstract>

  <abstract>Title: SlackLess Production - be fast, innovative and responsive

Building and maintaining cool software products is what we all strive for. And yet how often do we find ourselves in IT-hell with struggles like
- legacy code that looks as if id had been producted on the shore
- endless unproductive meetings in startup companies
- IT-Projects that have already sucked up 100 Million € over the past five years and there is still no product

I will give a management perspective what to do to bring back values like coolness, nerdism, professionally, respect, fun, technology into the IT-hell. I will talk about becoming fast, innovative and responsive. I will talk about the fun in IT. I will talk about values in IT that glue professional teams together.

  <abstract>&quot;Cloud&quot; is forcing a fundamental shift in enterprise application architecture towards a highly distributed, highly parallelized, horizontal scale-out services model. Traditional means of scale-out based on the RPC and JEE deployment model are showing their limitations when it comes to the &quot;cloud&quot;.

Over the past several years, with the emergence of simple J2SE-based frameworks, open TCP and non-blocking-I/O-based messaging/eventing middleware, and noSQL data stores, it is easier than ever to deliver simple and cost-effective solutions that enable the flexible distribution and parallelization of your business applications in the cloud. This new breed of middleware allows you to base your cloud application architecture on distributed light-weight Java-based components that use simple, open messaging and eventing for inter-process collaboration.

In this very hands-on presentation Oleg will build a case for the importance of Messaging architecture in the world of the cloud and show how the use of open technologies such as Spring Integration, NodeJS, RabbitMq etc., will allow you to quickly build reliable, highly available, scalable and portable systems with predictable and consistent throughput and latency.

This session consists of 35% slide-ware and 65% live coding.</abstract>

Scala, Clojure, F#, functional languages, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc), 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>In this session Oleg will give a short overview of the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) as catalogued in the highly influential book of the same name and Spring Integration (SI) framework. As one of the core developers of the Spring Integration(SI) framework, Oleg will provide a quick introduction of Spring Integration, its API and will demonstrate how SI enables the development of Message and Event based systems. Along the way, you will see how SI builds upon familiar Spring idioms such as interceptors, templates, strategy and other patterns and you will see alternative configuration options such as Scala DSL for SI. You will also see how SI maximizes reuse of the integration support available in the Spring Framework core for everything from remoting, JMS/AMQP, data, transactions, task execution and others flattening the learning curve considerably for those already familiar with Spring framework.

After attending this workshop, you will be able to start applying these patterns immediately within your Spring-based applications to solve many of the challenges of enterprise integration.

This session consists of 30% slide-ware and 70% live coding.

  <abstract>Developing a product over years is a tough job. It is hard for the team to stay excited on a day to day basis. So how can you improve motivation and innovation of agile teams and still keep the focus on building a great product?

I want to share with you how we at Atlassian used an agile approach to become one of the most successful developer tool companies in the world. This talk will cover topics like FedEx days, 20-percent time, keeping distraction away from developers, lunchtime talks, dogfooding and much more. </abstract>

  <topics>7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>If applications grow bigger, modularity becomes a key aspect regarding maintainability. Design decisions made in the early days are hardly discoverable in the codebase, inter-module dependencies grow a lot. The talk introduces means and approaches to connect logical architecture to the codebase. Beyond that we discuss patterns and best practices around general code organization, package structures to build a solid foundation for Java applications and in how far Spring can help creating loosely coupled components and dedicated points to extend applications.</abstract>

  <keywords>Spring, NoSQL, Neo4J, MongoDB</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>Spring always provided sophisticated support for various Java data access technologies. The lately coined Spring Data project now takes the next step and introduces a consistent programming model for non-relational data stores and helps implementing data access layers in a consistent and easy-to grasp fashion - for both the NoSQL stores as well as more traditional APIs like JPA. The talk introduces the umbrella project, foundational concepts and abstractions and dives down into specialties of particular modules using MongoDB and Neo4J as example.</abstract>

  <title>Spring Data JPA - Repositories done right</title>
  <keywords>Spring, JPA, persistence, domain driven design</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>Domain driven design has become a ubiquitous approach to tackle complex problem domains and build a rich object model. Furthermore JPA has become the standard and widely accepted way of object persistence in the Java world. The talk introduces the the Spring Data project in general with a focus on the JPA module that allows developers to easily implement JPA based repositories in a sophisticated way. We start with a brief analysis of a plain JPA based repository implementation and outline pain points esp. regarding the domain driven approach (lack of abstraction, tediousness of executing queries, pagination and so on). The main part of the talk then takes a look at how Spring Data JPA provides solutions to those problems. The presentation is 80% hands on - less slides, more code :).</abstract>

  <topics>1.2. Java Containers, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.3. BPM</topics>
  <abstract>The Java EE platform already offers a set of solutions to recurring problems such as persistence, transaction management or security. But the aspect missing for many applications is business process management (BPM). In this talk, I want to show how the Open Source Process Engine Activiti can be perfectly integrated in Java EE 6 and how CDI can be used to offer declarative, contextual process management. We show the JBoss AS 7 integration as example how the process engine can be a first class citizen in the Java EE container. In the talk I demonstrate and discuss a working example application using JSF, CDI, EJB, Drools and Activiti, how to easily test this using JBoss Arquillian and which tool chain may make sense in a development project using this environment.</abstract>

  <title>Ensure Software Security already in development</title>
  <keywords>Security, SDLC, SSA </keywords>
  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>Most companies, when they think about Security think about their perimeters and how you can bolt on security there.

Lucas v. Stockhausen will take you on a journey, where security is already started during the planing, design and implementation, so that an Application can protect itself from the inside out.

He will explain various processes and techniques which help an organization to get beyond the point, where security is an afterthought and not considered as an essential part of the development process. He will explain how an Organization can life Software Security and not only have it in the documents. They even can save money with that.

Explanation of the general topic/problem, description of why the delegates should attend the presentation, and highlights of the technologies/concepts the presentation is going to cover. Please make the main arguments of your proposed presentation clear and why this topic is important.

Breaches happend in the last years, like Sony, HBGary or Heartland Payment Systems stated clear, that Perimeter Security on its own will not solve the Problem of Security. In fact Security has to be build in already during Design and Implementation. Lucas v. Stockhausen will show with concepts like sourcecode analysis and early testing, and the depending processes this can be achieved.

  <topics>1.2. Java Containers, 1.3. PaaS Platforms, Runtimes, Services, 1.4. PaaS/Provisioning, 1.5. PaaS/Security, 1.6. PaaS/Practical Experience, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc), 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>This talk introduces the Java EE 7 platform, the latest revision of the Java platform for the enterprise. The focus of Java EE 7 is on the cloud, and specifically it aims to bring Platform-as-a-Service providers and application developers together so that portable applications can be deployed on any cloud infrastructure and reap all its benefits in terms of scalability, elasticity, multitenancy, etc. The existing specifications in the platform such as JPA, Servlets, EJB, and others will be updated to meet these requirements.

Furthermore, Java EE 7 continues the ease of development push that characterized prior releases by bringing further simplification to enterprise development. It also adds new, important APIs such as the REST client API in JAX-RS 2.0 and the long awaited Concurrency Utilities for Java EE API. Expression Language 3.0 and Java Message Service 2.0 will under go extreme makeover to align with the improvements in the Java language. There are plenty of improvements to several other components. Newer web standards like HTML 5 and Web Sockets will be embraced to build modern web applications.

This talk will provide a complete introduction to the Java EE 7 platform, including different components, and provide a roadmap.</abstract>

  <title>Death by dogma versus assembling agile</title>
  <keywords>Agile,Scrum,Kanban,Dogmagile,Beyond agile,Assembling agile</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches, 9.4. Experiences using new approaches like DevOps or LeanStartUp</topics>
  <abstract>Almost all organizations, large and small, are turning towards agile to escape failing traditional software development projects. Due to this strong increase in popularity of agile approaches and techniques, many newcomers will enter the field of agile coaching. Many of them without the very necessary real-life experience but proudly waving their agile certificates proving they at least had two days of training.

During this challenging talk appreciated international speaker Sander Hoogendoorn, global agile thought leader at Capgemini, shows what happens with organizations and projects which are coached by well-willing consultants with little experience. Often this leads to very dogmatic applications of the more popular agile approaches, mostly Scrum and Kanban. This dogmatic thinking currently blocks the use of more elaborate techniques, tools and technology in agile projects, even when these would really improve projects. “No, you cannot do modeling in Scrum” and “Burn-down charts are mandatory” are two such simple real-life example statements. Due to this lack of experience and the growing dogmatism in the agile beliefs, more and more agile projects will fail.

But maybe even more important during this talk Sander will also show that there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all agile. Different organizations and different projects require different agile approaches. Sometimes lightweight agile, user stories, simple planning and estimation is just fine. But in many projects the way of working used should rather be built up from slightly more enterprise ready approaches, for example using Smart or FDD, smart use cases, standardized estimation, multiple distributed teams and on-line dashboards. During this talk Sander demonstrates how to assemble an agile approach that is specifically suitable for YOUR project, of course with many examples from real-life agile implementations.

  <title>The Invisible Man. The role of testers in agile.</title>
  <keywords>Agile,Scrum,testing,XP,Smart</keywords>
  <topics>9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches, 9.4. Experiences using new approaches like DevOps or LeanStartUp</topics>
  <abstract>In agile projects, testing is considered of major importance. In agile projects, working in short iterations allows projects to bend Boehm’s Law of exponentially rising costs of finding an fixing bugs. So one might suggest that the role of testers is clearly defined in agile approaches and methodologies. Yet surprisingly, other than unit testing, which is more a development than a test technique, the most popular approaches such as Scrum, XP and Kanban do not clearly describe the role of testers and testing.

During this interactive talk Sander Hoogendoorn, principal technology officer and global agile thought leader at Capgemini will show how testing actually plays a role in their day to day work in real-life agile projects. This talk will clearly demonstrate what test activities are deployed in the development life cycle of work items, such as developer testing, functional testing, acceptance testing and end user approval testing and when and how these are performed. They will also illustrate the effect of positive effects of testing when working in long-running agile projects in iterations and releases. Here additional test activities are evidently required, including early release preparation, defining release test scenario’s and cases. Sander is currently active in some multi-year spanning agile projects, mixing best practices from Scrum, Smart, and test driven development.

  <title>How smart use cases drive agile web development</title>
  <keywords>Use cases,smart use cases,MVC,MVP,MVVM,MVWTF,software architecture</keywords>
  <topics>10.2. Integration architecture (SOA and the like), 10.4. Dealing with technical debts in the enterprise (e.g. addressing it in a distributed setting)</topics>
  <abstract>Use cases have been around for many years describing the requirements of software development projects. From a developer’s point of view, use cases are often seen as too abstract and too complex to develop code from. Until now, that is.

During this interactive talk, speaker Sander Hoogendoorn will demonstrate how to model, generate (using model driven development) and build smart use cases. This great technique allows you to model use cases at a much more pragmatic, low-granular level, enabling to be implemented simply and directly into applications built in ASP.NET or Silverlight for example. Thus smart use cases fit well in your layered software architecture, implementing the task pattern and delivering great traceability between requirements, design, coding and testing.

Using many real-life code examples and demos, the speaker will introduce both the positive impact that smart use cases have on your layered software architecture, as well as the design patterns required to implement them. Furthermore, the speaker will demonstrate how smart use cases can be unit tested as well, thus achieving great code coverage and allow to do regression testing automatically.

  <topics>10.2. Integration architecture (SOA and the like), 10.4. Dealing with technical debts in the enterprise (e.g. addressing it in a distributed setting)</topics>
  <abstract>In the Netherlands we are running in intriguing project for a major social security agency building an ASP.NET web application on top of one of the largest COBOL installations in the country. This 25 person (and growing) project includes many different aspects that make life challenging, including combining ASP.NET, an open source MVC implementation, a process layer based on modeling smart use cases, domain driven design, model driven development (with code generation) and some huge COBOL back end systems that deliver and receive data not in services but instead in byte arrays, leaving the team with loads of functional and technical challenges, including mixing .NET and COBOL development, applying and building frameworks and many transformation questions to be answered.

During this talk appreciated international speaker Sander Hoogendoorn, principal technology officer and global agile thought leader at Capgemini, and chief software architect for this project, will discuss the many architectural and technical issues this project needed to solve, and will demonstrates the modeling, architectural and design patterns applied to the solution the project is implementing. These include modeling requirements in smart use cases, and converting these into code, how to unit test mixed .NET and COBOL code, collaborating with COBOL designers and developers in .NET a project, transforming byte arrays into domain models. This talk comes live from the trenches with many code examples and demos from the actual application being built, presenting the opportunity for participants to learn a from real life complex mixed technology project.

  <title>How to Test Modern Enterprise Java Applications</title>
  <keywords>unit test, integration test, acceptance test, JEE, continuous integration </keywords>
  <topics>3.1.  Java &amp; JavaScript, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>Ten years ago to present, Enterprise Java Applications have suffered many changes. We have moved from Enterprise Applications built with JSP+Servlet and EJB, to much more complex applications. Nowadays with the advent of HTML5 or JavaScript libraries like JQuery, client side development has changed significantly. With the emergence of web frameworks like Spring MVC or JSF, server side code has quite changed compared to the one used when each web-form was mapped to a Servlet. And also persistence layer has changed with Java Persistence standard or with new database approaches like Data-Grid, Key-Values stores or Document stores.

Due to development of Enterprise Java Applications have changed during these years, so testing frameworks have changed accordantly. The main topic of this speech will be how to write clean and effective unit, integration and acceptance tests for Modern Enterprise Java Applications.

We are going to explore how to test JavaScript written on client side using Jasmine, how to write unit tests of server side with JUnit and Mockito, and how to validate persistence layer.

Moreover we will touch a way to write integration tests with Arquillian and Byteman and writing acceptance tests on all system using Thucydides.

Finally we are going to integrate all kind of test on your continuous integration system.

Session will combine theory with interactive practice.</abstract>

I would like to remark that this presentation should try to be as practical as possible so attendees could learn exactly how these test framework work.
Because I work developing critical software, testing is present in my day to day, so I think that my experience could be shared by all attendees.  </paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>New technologies, web frameworks or newborn languages are very important for every developer and are crucial to improve developers&#039; skills. However, there is set of skills that very often developers miss and don&#039;t do anything to improve in this area and speed their growth.

If you ever had a feeling that you don&#039;t have enough time to do what you are supposed to do...

If you keep thinking about work when you are at home...

If you keep postponing things that are important to you, because there is no time and allowance to do it before you finish &quot;your work&quot;...

If you think that you should have changed your job because you are just a cog on the production line...

If you attend a meeting that was waste of time...

Come by and learn how to do what your manager want you to do and still have plenty of time for stuff that you care about.

After this talk, your work hours will no longer be the same. You will start enjoying your job and feel fulfilled. And as important as that, your manager will notice increased productivity and performace.

Sounds like a magic? You can learn it in less than 60 minutes.</abstract>

  <abstract>We all know that good developer is worth 10 times as much as average developer.

Have you consider what you need to do to be considered as &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;average&quot;? Is technical knowledge enough to be considered as valuable team member? What about soft skills, communication, kindness and being helpfull? That&#039;s just basic. There is much more you can do easily to move from &quot;average&quot; to &quot;good&quot;.

If you hate being just a cog in the corporate kingdom, come to the talk and learn how to become indispensable developer that everybody would love to have in their team.</abstract>

  <abstract>One of the biggest challenges of many web applications is the support on the different browsers with different versions. JavaScript code that runs on Safari does not necessarily mean it will work on IE or Firefox or Google chrome.

This challenge is inherited from the lack of testing the JavaScript code that lives in the presentation tier from day one. Without unit testing the JavaScript code, organization will pay much money for testing, re-testing, and re-testing web applications for just deciding upgrading or supporting new browsers.

In this session, I will illustrate in details how to efficiently unit test the JavaScript code of our existing or new web application.</abstract>

  <abstract>Software applications are continually changing, appears new requirements, bugs, enhancements, … that should be implemented. Each change is a kick off of a cascade of events which culminate in the delivery of the product. The duration of this change will depend on how many stages are between writing specification and delivering to production. The problem arises when your are developing critical software like clinical instruments, where each step should be clearly oriented to ensure the correctness of change on whole application, enforcing communication and making change trackable.

In this presentation I will explain how to create a continuous integration platform for critical projects where a change is isolated from the rest of application until all tests are passed and code is reviewed. Moreover I will show you how a change is tracked from taking requirements to delivery, and how communication occurs between all actors involved in the change.

Platform will be built using open source projects like Jenkins, Gerrit, Mylyn.</abstract>

  <abstract>In the last few years, OSGi has become &quot;the&quot; module system for Java - but is OSGi just for gurus, or are mere mortals actually able to use it?

The simple tutorial RESTful server application presented in this talk aims to demonstrate that the average Java developer can actually use OSGi, and greatly benefit from it. It is built from scratch based on a set of standard and custom OSGi services, in a simple and understandable way.

Taking advantage of a number of build plugins and runtime tools provided by the Apache Felix and Apache Sling projects allows us to write little code in our example application, while exposing the advantages of an OSGi-based architecture in a simple and convincing way.

Our walkthrough of the example application will give developers a way to get started with OSGi, without getting bogged in unnecessary details.</abstract>

  <title>Open Development in the Enterprise</title>
  <keywords>opendevelopment,collaboration,teamwork</keywords>
  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>Open Development is often mentioned in open source circles nowadays, as a way to make projects really open, sustainable and based on meritocracy rather than on people&#039;s titles or hierarchical ranking.

Does this model have its place in the enterprise? Can we apply the open source governance models to enterprise projects, where you&#039;d usually expect a strictly hierarchical decision making process?

The open collaboration methods used by the R&amp;D group of Adobe CQ5 (formerly Day Software) demonstrate that this is not only possible, but brings measurable benefits in terms of agility, employee satisfaction and quality of the final product.

This talk describes the key elements that make this possible, and provides pointers to developers or project leaders to start using such a model in their own projects.

  <title>Defining an Understanding</title>
  <keywords>knowledge management, glossary, definition, demand, requirement</keywords>
  <topics>11.1. Creating a learning organization</topics>
  <abstract>How Aristotle would build a project glossary.

Clarity in the definitions of the key project concepts is crucial for communication between developers and technicians, and business. But even with carefully tended glossaries, there is confusion regarding to the meaning of terms. Already the greek philosopher Aristotle has dealt with the problem how one can define terms clearly, and the line of philosophers who have spent there time with this issue reaches to the 20th Century, namely to Ludwig Wittgenstein. For the project daily life we can learn a lot from it.

Aristotle&#039;s way of defining concepts and notions starts with something that we know today as object orientated thinking with generalization and specialization. For deriving definitions in such a way Aristotle gives us another hint: the four kinds of causes.

However, not all concepts and notions can be defined in Aristotle&#039;s way. So we will have a look at Wittgenstein&#039;s idea of family similarities to deal with these situations.</abstract>

  <title>Acting with Uncertainties</title>
  <keywords>Uncertainties, project goals, process definitions, decision making</keywords>
  <topics>11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>It is almost as certain as the fact that the future will come at all, that it will bring surprises. In everyday life of the IT project sometimes just the fact is the surprise that everything turned out just as it was planned. Sometimes we ignore that and prepare ourselves for the future, as if we knew what it brings. In other cases, we try to anticipate exceptions and deviations. What are the differences, and what are the reasons for our different behaviour in similar situations?

If we do not know how likely it is that something does not work as planned, even to name the potential harm, how could we ever come to decisions for an action? In fact, we notice in everyday life that uncertainty sometimes is paralyzing, we often can not decide to direct action and we find us driven by external forces.

To want something begins with having a goal to which one wants to go to. The first step towards this goal is to have a picture of it. This image can be very simple, it can be an ideal. It&#039;s actually not at all useful to make a very accurate picture for the future, because almost as certain as the claim that there will be future, is that it brings surprises. A very specific and accurate picture of the future has the disadvantage that it will never correspond to reality. It is sufficient having an idea regarding a possible future so accurately that one can deduce what can be done for the realization of this picture. Therefore, we are developing standards and guidelines at all, so we define process models. They give a purpose to our actions. If surprises happen, then this is like a distraction that throws us off track. This may mean that we need to change the direction to achieve the same goal, but it may be that we need to change the target. It is idle to speculate whether one ever hase achieved the original target, it is important that you always have a goal that gives the action its direction.</abstract>

  <abstract>Together with the release of Java EE 6, Oracle has provided a number of different tools to help you get the most out of the platform. In this session, you&#039;re introduced to the rapid application development tools in NetBeans, which is Oracle&#039;s IDE for the Java Platform, while an application will be built from scratch leveraging all the main features that the Java EE 6 platform makes available.

Starting from JPA, moving on to EJB, Servlets, JSF, and JAX-RS, you&#039;ll see how the Java EE 6 platform&#039;s subspecifications integrate with each other very well to produce very powerful yet, for the first time, extremely lightweight applications. By the end of the session, you&#039;ll have a much better understanding of the advantages of Java EE 6 over previous versions, as well as over other web frameworks, and you&#039;ll be ready to create specification-based enterprise applications yourself.</abstract>

  <title>Performance Anti-Patterns in Hibernate</title>
  <keywords>hibernate, performance, anti-patterns</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>Hibernate is an elegant, straightforward, and easy to use library. This is undeniably true for simple domain models. What about more complex ones? It turns out that in case of complex domain models we usually run into interesting performance issues.

This talk discusses performance anti-patterns on both levels the code of hibernate itself as well as the usage of hibernate in custom applications. First, we present several places in hibernate code that negatively impact performance of object-relational mappings. Then, we explain common mistakes or omissions related to mappings of complex structures. The focus is on efficient retrieval of collections and their sub-objects along with fetching strategies and efficient queries. The presented real code examples illustrate how the anti-patterns can decrease performance and how to implement the mappings to speed up execution times.</abstract>

  <title>Safety first with Apache Camel Security</title>
  <keywords>Apache Camel, Integration, Security</keywords>
  <topics>5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 7.2. Security</topics>
  <abstract>Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework for Java developers and offers route configuration with XML or Java. Several systems, from databases to messaging systems to web services, can be easily integrated in Camel routes. While more and more companies integrate their different systems with Camel, security requirements are often ignored or the chosen solution is not fully integrated with Camel.

So with the transport of sensitive information, it is the developer’s job to protect the data accordingly. Besides that, only authorized users should have access to certain Camel routes. To fulfill these requirements, Camel already provides several cryptographic components out of the box. At the same time, Camel can be extended with third party security frameworks like Apache Shiro and Spring Security.

This session presents the various possibilities in securing Camel and their integration into different routes. Besides the usage of Camel&#039;s own crypto components, we will have a closer look at the integration of additional security frameworks and their usage in the Camel configuration.</abstract>

  <abstract>Developing mobile applications is a challenging task, especially given the ever-growing number of mobile platforms, devices and form factors. Implementing an app for just one platform just isn&#039;t an option for any serious enterprise if they want to reach as many clients as possible. In this session, I will give a brief overview of the main approaches for developing cross-platform mobile applications. We&#039;ll start with native apps, and work our way through hybrid applications and interpreted apps to HTML 5 based solutions. To illustrate these approaches, I will demonstrate each of them using commercial products or open source tools such as PhoneGap (now Callback), jQuery mobile, Sencha Touch, Titanium Appcelerator, Applause and more.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>This is a demo-intensive session. I will present a few slides in order to explain the important concepts, but a significant part of the session will consist of live demos on real devices. I will also dig into PhoneGap and Titanium and explain in-depth how they work.

So, overall this is going to be a very entertaining AND educating session.

  <title>Platform as a Service (PaaS) for successful EAM</title>
  <keywords>PaaS, EAM, JEE, Governance</keywords>
  <topics>1.3. PaaS Platforms, Runtimes, Services, 1.6. PaaS/Practical Experience</topics>
  <abstract>Application development platforms (in terms of PaaS in the cloud computing reference architecture) offer a comprehensive solution for professional software development efforts. In times of high technical complexity, required flexibility and speed to build, they are a cornerstone for effective Enterprise Architecture Management of the technology stack. Additionally, they are an instrument to foster the goal of high reuse of proven solutions inside large companies. Successful rollouts of a PaaS require strong governance, a product-like development approach (e.g. release and requirements management), a working financing and organizational model and strong leadership and architectural skills to manage the platform.

This case study is showing an overview, best practices and pitfalls from successful real life PaaS implementations at major German financial services companies where large-scale (private cloud) PaaS for Java EE development and runtime with a broad coverage of technology were developed and rolled out throughout the last years. The platforms typically consist of the entire stack ranging from development processes, frameworks to operational infrastructure for development and runtime purposes and are serving a multitude of projects working successfully with it. Special focus in this presentation is how the PaaS-concept integrates with the EAM strategy and how a working architecture governance model and financing and organization aspects should look like.

  <title>Successful with Scrum - The contribution of HR</title>

  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.3. Involving HR/personal management, 11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>„Do I have to bury my career plans?“

„What, I am supposed to lead without power?“

„Who gets the bonus, if the focus is on the team?“

„Am I allowed to set goals to individual team members?“

Everybody who is working with Scrum will be confronted with such questions sooner or later in the process of implementation. Until now the Community has extensively discussed how to apply the principles of Scrum properly but there has hardly been any discussion about all those other question marks coming along with Scrum. But they are most important: those surrounding topics massively influence processes and the organization of a company. Those are questions of working together with other, non-Scrum departments and with customers for example. But it‘s the real „soft“ questions of HR-Management that can be tricky for teams and enterprises because Scrum has the inherent power to shatter the „safe places“:

It transforms positions into roles

It focuses on efficiency and achievements of the team

It opens new options of pursuing careers

It asks leaders rather to be enablers than commanders and partially forces them to abandon direct disciplinary power

In their traditional ways HR-Tools like recruiting, talent management &amp; development, performance management, compensation &amp; benefits are built around the individual. This limits their applicability to agile needs. Given these preconditions several players have to „move“ from their comfort zones: the HR-department, management, the team and each team member.

In the course of my presentation we would like to adress two aspects:

Which impact does the implementation of Scrum have on traditional HR-tools and how can they be transformed into agile tools?

Scrum itself and the transformation of HR-tools means that leadership has to say goodbye to absolute power. Within the new setting, leadership responsibilities are distributed on different roles, from management to each team member. Leaders have to develop new competences in leading laterally and situative. Agility starts with each individual and is - first of all - a question of properly leading yourself. Which attitudes, values and tools does one need to fulfill those challenging tasks?

Listeners to my presentation will get hands-on advice for adapting HR-Management to agile requirements. I want to open the eyes of Scrum-“users“, managers and HR-Manager to the organizational impact of Scrum.

  <abstract>Continuous Build Systems are well established tools in agile development teams. They ensure that integrated products

pass a variety of quality gates, including but not limited to test coverage, succcessful test execution and code quality.

During a build cycle, along with the final product, they produce a fair amount of artifacts that document the build process,

like test reports, code quality metrics and of course code documentation itself. However some of the crucial

knowledge of the intrinsic dynamics of the implemented features of the software system is not picked up during a

typical build process. This talk shows a mechanism that creates a set of up date dynamic diagramming as part

of the continuous build process as well

as in the IDE at developers fingertips.

This dynamics are usually sketched during the agile process as a set of interaction diagrams on a flip chart or using some modelling tool. Based on this understanding, a test case is created that includes test to cover the required feature.

While the original diagrams will likely end up in some documentation silo, they usually become outdated right through the development process as developers discover additional testing avenues to complete test coverage for the given feature. Moreover, regular refactoring is likely to change the intrinsical workings of the software system, thus rendering the original diagramming obsolete.

In the continuous build, the diagrams are included in the generated documentation for the individual test executions thus becoming an automatic and seamless by-product of the build cycle.

This ensures up to date documentation of the actual dynamic processes on a feature by feature basis. As a result, developers can readily verify that an application behaves as intended.

New developers joining an Agile Team have a flying start since they are no longer confronted with an outdated view of the intrinsic dynamics of their feature domain. The tooling shown works using the Java programming language and Eclipse but can be easily extended to other programming languages including those with a dynamic type system.

The talk is geared towards build managers and other stakehoders in an agile development environment that are employing or considering continuous build and delivery paradigms.</abstract>

  <title>Beyond Ant &amp; Maven: System Centric Java with Z2</title>
  <keywords>build management, java server, system centric</keywords>
  <topics>1.2. Java Containers, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>This talk is about the z2-Environment framework (www.z2-environment.eu) and the System-Centric Development approach.

When solutions get larger and spread out into extensions and loosely connected areas of functionality, when development teams become distributed, means of efficiently assuring productivity and quality become the Achilles heel of successful development operations.

Maintaining a build system and requiring developers to configure and run local builds is a major source of additional complexity and errors.

The z2-Environment is a System-Centric approach to solution development that fosters rapid integration and always consistent system code lines at minimal local development setup, no build configuration whatsoever, and minimal shared infrastructure.

It strongly contrasts with distribution and release management approaches promoted by the Maven toolkit via its solution oriented nature that emphasizes consistency and maintainability vs. Maven&#039;s loose coupling via versioned binary artifacts.

This talk will highlight the most significant concepts of the framework and show how the toolset is used in a real-world solution in a live demonstration.

The audience should be interested in production and development problems of non-trivial software systems. People interested in product line engineering should find the concepts exciting.

Outline

(I) Motivation

1. Why build systems suck

2. Why developers integrate late

3. Why Maven doesn&#039;t solve the problem you thought it solves

(II) Analysis

1. Pull vs. push: Don&#039;t break the chain

2. The costs of local environments

3. Systems live on customization, libraries live on compatibiliy

(III) Solution

1. The source IS the system

2. Principles of the implementation

(IV) Demos

1. Get ready to change a “slice” of the system

2. Test, commit, integrate.</abstract>

  <title>On Processors, Compilers and @Configurations</title>
  <keywords>Java, Annotation Processor, Compiler API, Spring Java Configuration</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>The Pluggable Annotation Processing API allows application developers to write customized annotation processors that can be plugged into the Java compiler to process annotated source files during compilation. The automatic generation of additional source code and customized validations of the annotated classes are the two most important purposes of custom annotation processors.

The Java Compiler API, a feature introduced with Java 6, makes it possible to run the java compiler programmatically at runtime. It provides a convenient API to set the paths and options, run the compilation and as a result thereof obtain diagnostic messages and the compiled artifacts without having to execute the Java compiler binary as an external process.

Both, the pluggable annotation processors and the compiler API, are advanced Java SE technologies that are not known by many otherwise experienced developers and most literature lacks a decent coverage of these topics.

The Java based configuration style is the rising star when it comes to Spring application context configurations and its adoption and importance increases with every of the framework&#039;s release. Fundamental to this way of context configuration are the two annotations @Bean, used on so called bean definition methods, and @Configuration, used on the classes containing these methods. Due to the nature of the inversion of control pattern and the way Spring works, there are a number of well documented constraints configuration classes and methods must adhere to. Unfortunately, non-conforming classes are only detected at runtime despite the availability of techniques to signal most of the problems much earlier during the compilation.

We will use the missing compile time validation of Spring @Configuration classes as example throughout the talk. We will show how an annotation processor can be employed to validate annotated classes at compile time and how well it can be integrated into development tools like Maven and Eclipse. Then we will discuss how most of the challenges encountered while writing unit tests for the annotation processor can be tackled with the Java compiler API. The example in this talk will be based on a simplified version of the &#039;Spring Configuration Validation Processor&#039; [1], an open source project by the speaker.

  <title>How to architect a startup</title>
  <keywords>startup, software engineering, architecture, agile</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches, 9.3. Involving HR/personal management, 10.1. Cloud Computing for the enterprise, 10.2. Integration architecture (SOA and the like), 11.3. Supporting innovations without bargaining sustainability</topics>
  <abstract>This presentation is all about software engineering at a startup, from the beginning to the first rollout of their application(s) and beyond.

The main topics a startup has to deal with are agility in a very fast pacing environment, how to handle expectations of different stakeholders, how to build a team, how to manage the development process and how to face the technical challenges when you only have one shot to build the perfect, scalable architecture.

At eGym GmbH, we are developing our own eco system of applications including a web application and some mobile apps. The talk will unveil our approaches to the questions elaborated above. We will explain how up-to-date methods in software engineering and technologies like cloud can help an emerging company to keep a lean structure and to focus on what counts for success: the product.

By providing some handy thoughts and insights in how a startup actually works the talk is a case study for developers, software architects and project managers who are interested in entrepreneurship or who are just looking for some startup spirit and fresh ideas for their projects.</abstract>

  <title>Apache Cassandra for Big Data Applications</title>
  <keywords>nosql, databases, cassandra, infrastructure</keywords>
  <topics />
  <abstract>The NoSQL phenomenon has been attracting a lot of attention in the past few years. Driven by their need to accommodate high volumes of real-time data, major internet companies have popularized the use of data storage solutions that differ from traditional RDBMS. One example of such a solution is the Apache Cassandra distributed database management system. Originally developed by Facebook to power their inbox search, Cassandra combines a schema-flexible data model (borrowed from Google&#039;s BigTable) with a fully distributed, shared-nothing design (borrowed from Amazon&#039;s Dynamo). This allows Cassandra to offer high availability, linear scalability and high performance while relaxing some consistency guarantees.

This talk will give developers and software architects an overview of the fundamentals of Apache Cassandra. We will discuss the core concepts of the system, such as its data model, its query language and its cluster architecture. We will also review data replication and consistency and look at a real-world application built upon Cassandra, as it is used at Scandit to manage millions of products and barcode scans.

The goal of this session is that attendees know the main concepts behind Cassandra and their implications. This will let them understand both the benefits and limitations of the system, and it will help them to quickly get started with their own deployment.</abstract>

  <abstract>How often have you had to put debug into your code to write out fields in an object or even entire data collections or inserted print statements only to see the problem disappear? The Memory Analyzer open source tool (eclipse.org/mat) is an extensible cross-platform tool that provides you with insight into the Java code you’ve written and enable you to debug some of those tricky problems. By extending MAT with knowledge of your application you can enable both yourselves and your users to visualise the state of the application: from the contents of caches to the state of in-flight operations, and use this to easily identify problems including configuration, memory footprint and unexpected behaviour.</abstract>

  <abstract>When you write Java code the JVM makes a number allocations on your behalf, but do you have an understanding of how much that is?  This session provides an insight into the memory usage of Java code, covering the memory overhead of putting in &quot;int&quot; into an Integer object and the cost of object delegation and the memory efficiency of the different collection types as well as providing you with an understanding of the off-Java (native) heap memory usage of some types of Java objects (eg. Threads, Sockets etc). Most importantly, this session will cover how to determine where there are inefficiencies in your application, and how to choose the right collections to improve your Java code.</abstract>

  <title>Large scale testing in an Agile world</title>
  <keywords>Agile, Large scale testing, Java</keywords>
  <topics>9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches</topics>
  <abstract>Followers of Agile development practices will know that with the arrival of new function comes new bugs and new bug fixes.  Therefore  it is critically important to regularly run existing tests  ( to check for regressions) , as well as new tests.  Deciding what to run and how frequently to run it needs to be carefully considered, especially when it is not feasible to run all tests on every build.   

Testing the IBM Java SE product  is a larger task that you may expect - To the casual user it is a black box that provides you with a base on which to run your Java applications, but peek beneath the surface and you find a complex combination of systems including not only the core VM, but also a JIT compiler, Garbage Collector, base Class Libraries as well as bundled value add libraries.   Coupled with the wide range of platforms supported and the geographical spread of the development teams  the challenge facing the test teams is high.

This talk focuses on how implementation of Java is tested across a worldwide organisation in an Agile development environment.  The  focus will be on the high level of automation required to support continual verification across a wide and disparate set of  platforms (including AIX, Linux (x86, Power and zSeries), Windows and z/OS ) and how to efficiently handle the triaging, debugging and defect raising for tests that fail. </abstract>

  <title>Serialization: Tips, Traps, and Techniques</title>
  <keywords>Java serialization, Techniques, </keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>Java serialization is a powerful core technology used by many applications and as an underpinning for many sophisticated Java technologies such as RMI, EJB, SDO, JPA, and distributed caching. Yet its implications for the design of Java systems are often overlooked. This presentation explains the continuing relevance of Java serialization.

Whether for designing a system specifically concerned with serialization, developing reusable components, or updating code in which serializable objects exist, a good understanding of serialization considerations is invaluable. Learn about common serialization pitfalls and techniques for their solution, and get tips on optimizing the efficiency of serialized data.

This is a reprise of a well received talk given at JavaOne 2011</abstract>

  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>The JDK includes classes representing special types of Java references: soft, weak, and phantom. Used correctly, reference objects provide a powerful control mechanism for garbage collection of data structures to optimize performance and memory usage. Incorrectly used, they may not have the intended effect or, worse, applications can fail randomly and unexpectedly.

This session describes the different types of reference objects; intended uses, with code samples; potential pitfalls; and how to avoid them.</abstract>

  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 4.2. iOS Development, 4.5. Hardware related features (NFC, etc.), 7.2. Security</topics>
  <abstract>More and more enterprises are going mobile with their business related data. Allowing smartphones to access business data on the go helps to improve working efficiency and brings a great deal of new opportunities. On the downside, there are lots of threats such as loss of data in case of lost devices or unauthorized reading of sensitive data like e-mail, calendar or even confidential documents stored or processed by an enterprise application.

Being one of the most popular consumer smartphone platforms, iOS finds more and more it&#039;s way into the enterprise world.

In our talk we will focus on the iOS platform in general and on iOS 5 in particular. We will start with an overview of the iOS security architecture, including the enterprise integration and software security capabilities. Then we will take a closer look at the built-in data protection features in iOS. We will explain the protection classes of the iOS keychain as well as file protection and its impact.

This talk is targeted at software engineers and decision makers with a technical background. Software engineers will get insights on how their App data is protected and on how they can use iOS security features to better protect their data. Decision makers will get a better understanding of how iOS security works in general and of how iOS devices like iPhones can be used within an enterprise environment.</abstract>

  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>The Prediction of the future is very difficult or even impossible. But sill, we do it.

We use different estimation techniques, some are good, some are not. Some are rather complex, some are fairly easy. These techniques delude you to believe in an accuracy they don&#039;t have.

In this talk, I will look at the techniques and the problems of estimating, as well as empirical data questioning the validity. I will explore new techniques, based on cognitive psychology and good old common sense. Usually, we ask &quot;How long does something take to get done&quot;. By reversing this question to &quot;How much can we achieve in this time frame?&quot; you will get a better accuracy of your estimations and make you a better fortune-teller.

Target Audience: software architects, project managers, software-developers

  <paper_external_comment>I held presentations at the SEACON 2011 in Hamburg, at the OOP 2012 in München and at the Java User Group Switzerland in Januar 2012. For all my presentations, I received superiour delegate evaluations.
I&#039;m using the &quot;Lessig Method&quot; with images of a common theme, similar to the petcha-kutch style. Each slide holds only one information and will only be shown for a short time. This results in a presentation that is vivid and entertaining.
For this talk, I will use the theme of the film &quot;Mission impossible&quot;.</paper_external_comment>

  <keywords>self-organization, collaboration, agile, leading</keywords>
  <topics>11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>We know that self-organization is a critical aspect of every successful Agile project and we know that it takes trust, respect, openness and responsibility; so why many teams have a hard time to achieve it?

This talk is about the group dynamics that may hinder self-organization in Agile teams, seen from a behavioral perspective, and about the ways to counteract these issues.

The concept of self-organization is strictly related to empowering (or even better, emancipating) the technical teams, which in turn may alter both the &quot;vertical&quot; dynamics (managers/teams) and the &quot;horizontal&quot; dynamics (teammate/teammate).

Resistance may arise and the source is frequently rooted in mental habits, such as a latent blaming culture, confusing guidance and command, fear of taking responsibility or losing status, unconscious agendas.

Attend this session to learn, through insights and real-life stories from the field, how to deal with these kind of issues.

TARGET AUDIENCE

This session is intended for everyone actively working in a software development team, including technical team member, team leaders, project managers, product managers, Scrum Masters, Scrum Product Owners.

Experience in using Agile methods is useful but not required.</abstract>

  <title>How to keep your Architecture in good Shape?!</title>
  <keywords>architecture, quality, structure, metrics, automatic assessment</keywords>
  <topics>10.3. Architecture reviews and criterias for doing so, 10.4. Dealing with technical debts in the enterprise (e.g. addressing it in a distributed setting), 11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>Many software projects suffer from the fact that the initially designed architecture is not represented within the implementation after a couple of iterations. Unnoticed by the software architect and the developers the structure of the software eroded and the maintenance and enhancement of the product get harder and harder with each iteration.

There are many root causes for this kind of software entropy, e.g. time pressure, different levels of knowledge and skills among the developers, lacking quality awareness and insufficient tool support. The team senses these problems as rigidity, fragility, non-existent modularization and high complexity of the software. But how can these symptoms of structural erosion be measured and tracked reliably?

An important metric are the number and the size of cycle groups within the software, as these have a negative impact on reusability, extensibility, testability and comprehensibility.

The correct manual detection of cycles is an impossible task in larger projects therefore the assessment of the software must be done automatically and frequently, at best within the IDE to prevent cycles to be introduced by the developers and at least during the nightly build.

The comparison between current and target states should be done at macro and micro levels. At macro level a logical architecture, i.e. the big picture, is assessed and at micro level thresholds of various metrics are checked, for example the number of classes per package, the depth of inheritance, cyclomatic complexity of methods, etc. Tools allow the interconnection of the logical architecture with the implementation via the assignment of packages and types to the elements of the logical architecture.

There exist a number of open source and commercial tools that help to reduce the effort needed to assess and ensure the quality of software. The project team gets as an objective result the number of architecture and threshold violations and can track the progress at short intervals over time. The software architects are freed from the inspection duties and can instead concentrate on creative tasks.</abstract>

  <keywords>Maven, SubVersion, Bamboo, Sonar, SCM Patterns, Continuous Integration, gource, SCM metrics</keywords>
  <topics>6.5. Version Control, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>Software Configuration Management is a success factor for every professional software development. But, how do I do software configuration management right?

In a strict sense software configuration management is the reproducible storing of artifacts. It is not an isolated discipline. Software configuration management is a central element in the whole process of software development and inter-connected to other discipline (sales, product management, project management, development and delivery). In a multi-product environment software configuration management is very challenging and can easily get very complex.

In this talk I will cover the theoretical background, illustrate you the faced challenges of a multi-product environment by using an emerging example of a growing enterprise startup. I will also show you how software configuration management@Abraxas is realized. Furthermore I will present some interesting metrics and visualizations, that can be extracted from a version control system.

Target Audience: software architects, project managers, software-developers, SCM Managers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites: None</abstract>

  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>This talk is about bugs in software – how to reproduce find and fix them in a way so they do not pop up again.

The main goal of a software developer is to write &quot;good&quot; code. Good code means, that the code meets the business needs, but also that the code has a minimum number of defects. Many developers spend more time in debugging the code than writing new code. Thus, it is essential to known how to debug a program in a systematic, efficient way.

In this talk I will cover the knowledge and techniques of a systematic approach for debugging. Furthermore, I will present a comprehensive debugging tool set for Java.

Target Audience: software architects, software-developers

  <abstract>How can you see the light, when you never saw the darkness?

In this talk, you can improve your programming skills by learning from other programmers mistakes.

The reading of code is most likely one of the most common activities of a software developer. Source code is written once, but it is read multiple times. By reading real-life well-written code you get an insight on how to design a nontrivial system well.

In this talk I cover the background knowledge and techniques for reading code by looking at the code of several open-source projects. I will also talk about where the bad and ugly code comes from and how it smells. Furthermore, I present a comprehensive tool set for static and dynamic code analysis for java.

  <keywords>value semantic, immutable objects, functional thinking</keywords>
  <topics>7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc)</topics>
  <abstract>The usage of immutable objects can reduce the complexity of an application as well increase its performance.

Immutable objects cannot change the state after creation and they are said to have value semantics. Many basic types like integers, floating point numbers and strings (in java) are implemented as immutable objects. Immutable objects have a number of advantages, like no need for multi-threaded synchronization and freedom to cache without concern for data corruption, which make them easier to write, use, test and maintain. While immutability may not make sense for all classes, most applications have at least a few classes that would benefit from being immutable. In this talk I will demonstrate what immutable objects are, how they are defined and used. It shows you the advantages and disadvantages of immutable object in comparison to mutable objects.

Design principles (e.g. high cohesion, separation of concerns, …). are the foundation on which software development is based. Unfortunately design principles have a shadowy existence. By mistake, if they are used, they provide an immediate benefit in form of faster (time-to-market, performance) and better (number of bugs, extensibility, maintainability and reusability) results in all phases of the software development process.

  <title>Back to the bug - Time travel made possible</title>
  <keywords>Time travelling debugger, Reverse debugger, Post mortem debugger, omniscient debugger</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins</topics>
  <abstract>During debugging, how often have you missed the correct location of the breakpoint or stepped over the code, which causes the bug? &quot;Whoops, I went too far&quot;. I say, many, too many times. I always dreamed of a debugger, which is able to go back in time and show me the state of the application before the bug occurred. Not only step into, step over or step out, also step backwards! What was the value of that variable, that caught the bug? Which code changed it and why? I just want to go back in time.

This technique is called a post-mortem debugger (aka as time traveling debugger, reverse debugger or temporal debugger). A post-mortem debugger records the complete state of the application during time. After the problem shows up, the developer can go back in time and analyze the state which caused the problem. The approach lacks the disadvantages of the traditional debugging techniques, like guessing where to put breakpoints, stepping to the bug, unable to reproduce a non-deterministic bug.

This talk gives a brief introduction in general debug techniques and focuses on post-mortem debugging approach. It shows the general advantages and disadvantages, the techniques that are being used and the available products on the market. It also includes a demonstration of a post-mortem debugger for java.

Target Audience: software-developers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites: Experiences with debugging and Eclipse</abstract>
  <abstract_plain>During debugging, how often have you missed the correct location of the breakpoint or stepped over the code, which causes the bug? &quot;Whoops, I went too far&quot;. I say, many, too many times. I always dreamed of a debugger, which is able to go back in time and show me the state of the application before the bug occurred. Not only step into, step over or step out, also step backwards! What was the value of that variable, that caught the bug? Which code changed it and why? I just want to go back in time.

This technique is called a post-mortem debugger (aka as time traveling debugger, reverse debugger or temporal debugger). A post-mortem debugger records the complete state of the application during time. After the problem shows up, the developer can go back in time and analyze the state which caused the problem. The approach lacks the disadvantages of the traditional debugging techniques, like guessing where to put breakpoints, stepping to the bug, unable to reproduce a non-deterministic bug.

This talk gives a brief introduction in general debug techniques and focuses on post-mortem debugging approach. It shows the general advantages and disadvantages, the techniques that are being used and the available products on the market. It also includes a demonstration of a post-mortem debugger for java.

  <title>How to fake metrics – Or how valid are metrics?</title>
  <keywords>metrics, Heisenberg, fake, motivation, candle problem, Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, project management</keywords>
  <topics>9.3. Involving HR/personal management, 11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>Currently metrics experience a renaissance in different areas. Metrics are aggregated, correlated and visualized. Based on them, decisions are taken and actions performed.

The quality of the decisions and actions depends directly on the validity of the used metrics. But, how valid are metrics? And how valid in consequence are the taken decisions?

In this session I will show you some general problems that measuring in a system can cause. Furthermore, you will hear how easily metrics can be modified intentionally and why employees do this. I will also cover the effects that metrics have on quality and the impact they have on the motivation of employees.

  <title>Mutation testing-How to get more than 100%coverage</title>
  <keywords>Mutation testing, error seeding, quality of testing, test coverage, test methods</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>Do you know how good your test cases are? Mutation testing can give you the answer.

Mutation testing is emerging in the last few years. It is a software testing method which modifies the source or byte code (the modifications mimic typical programming errors) in small ways to see if this modification is detected by any test case. If a mutation survives the test cases, the test suite is incomplete and a test case should be added to kill the survived mutation. In this sense, mutation testing guides the developer to find weaknesses in the tests and gives him the direction to improve and enhance them.

This talk covers the basic idea of mutation testing and compares it with more main stream testing techniques like unit testing, static code analysis and test coverage. In the main part of the talk I will discuss the mutation testing approaches and its challenges by using an emerging example. I will conclude my personal experiences and give you a recommendation on how to get started with mutation testing.

  <abstract>This talk is about the Java compatible cloud technology as provided by Cloud Foundry. It evaluates its maturity and possible use in enterprise. In order to understand how this technology can be used, I will also compare it to other alternatives among the currently maturing cloud-based solutions.

The approach used to explore Cloud Foundry is that of a Java developer used to conventional development environment. You will learn about the shift from the conventional approach to a cloud based approach, and how Cloud Foundry brings a smooth transition from one to the other. I will also emphasize on the practical differences such as the deployments through an IDE, such as Eclipse, to a test server.

As enterprises are seeing more and more the value of virtualization and cloud technologies, the time has come for Java-based solutions to evolve and adopt those new paradigms and offer standard tools for Java developers.

  <abstract>How can you see the light, when you never saw the darkness?

In this talk, you can improve your programming skills by learning from other programmers mistakes.

The reading of code is most likely one of the most common activities of a software developer. Source code is written once, but it is read multiple times. By reading real-life well-written code you get an insight on how to design a nontrivial system well.

In this talk I cover the background knowledge and techniques for reading code by looking at the code of several open-source projects. I will also talk about where the bad and ugly code comes from and how it smells. Furthermore, I present a basic tool set for static and dynamic code analysis for java.

  <abstract>JAX-RS 1.x has been a hugely successful Java API for RESTful services development and a lot of real-world experience has resulted in a number of new features being proposed. JSR 339 was created in early 2011 with the objective of exploring and scoping all these proposals. The purpose of this technical talk is to provide a preview of all the new planned features in JAX-RS 2.0 that is going to be released soon.

The most commonly requested feature for JAX-RS 2.0 is a client API. Client APIs can range from low-level, just above HttpURLConnection, to high-level, often including support for IoC and hyperlinking. Other features that will be covered in this presentation include: asynchronous processing, hypermedia, validation, interceptors, improved content negotiation, etc.</abstract>

  <keywords>SUN ORACLE JAVA7 JAVAEE6 EJB3.1 NIO2 FORK JOIN</keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>There is a lot of speculation about the future of Java as Sun microsystems is taken over by Oracle. But the future is only bright and Sun will shine brighter. The work being done for Java7 and Java EE6 is an example of Oracle&#039;s commitment for Java.

This presentation takes you through the rich feature set that will be part of Java 7 and JavaEE6. We will discuss in detail the new features like Modularity, new Concurrency utilities, NIO2.0, and nextgen JMX. These features will be explained with illustrative examples.

We’ll also briefly discuss the language enhancements such as Closures, Type Inference, Catching multiple exceptions, Try with AutoClose( Automatic resource block management), and annotations on Java types.

There will be a special focus on new performance related enhancements such as Fork-join frameworks and the new G1 garbage collector.

This presentation will also give a quick overview of JavaEE6, the whole new ideology to take Spring head on. We will have a sneak peek on new profiles ( Web/Lite and Full ) and features like EJB3.1, Servlet3.0. JSP2.2,WebBeans and much more.

Presentation Goals:

After attending this session we expect the audience
- - to understand new features and enhancements in Java 7 and Java EE6
- - to get a kick-start to implement much needed features like NIO2 , JMX , Fork-Join etc

  <title>Divide&amp;Conquer: Efficient Java for Multicore World</title>
  <keywords>JAVA7 FORK JOIN MULTICORE PARALLEL PROCESSING COARSE GRAIN </keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>As the internet usage grows rapidly, the performance and scalability demands of our applications keep increasing at a faster rate. The future hardware trend is clear; Moore’s Law will be delivering more cores per chip rather than higher clock rates. As multi-core, multiprocessor systems become cheaper and readily available, more of our applications need to exploit the hardware parallelism to realize exponential performance gains.

Developers should give more thought to concurrency than they ever did, to efficiently utilize the available parallel hardware architecture. Considering the state-of-art hardware infrastructure we have and the critical nature of our applications, it is imperative that we need to take advantage of all the available processing power. This is critical for scaling the next generation of our applications and realizing the most possible performance.

Coarse-grained parallelism (servicing concurrent user requests) can help utilize multiple core to only a certain extent. Our engineers will need to find finer-grained parallelism to avoid keeping processors idle even though there is plenty of work to do. Java 7 will include the fork-join framework for representing finer-grained parallel algorithms.

This presentation will discuss various ways to utilize of the full potential of multi-core systems and provide an introduction to the Java 7 language capabilities, the fork-join framework &amp; constructs that facilitate finer-grained parallelism. Java 7 concepts and features will be demonstrated using a sample application. This session will be highly interactive with lots of sample code.

Presentation Goals:

After attending this session we expect the audience
- - to understand finer-granined parallelism concepts and frameworks
- - to understand Java 7 parallel features to effectively use the multi-core servers

Benefits:
- - Programming for mutli-core becomes a real issue
- - Efficient utilization of multi-core is the next best performance improvement we can get, so understanding this aspect would benefit developers to write high performing, scalable applications

  <title>Get lazy - Continuous Integration with Jenkins</title>
  <keywords>CI, Continuous Integration, Jenkins, Build, Test</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>Real developers are lazy, they don&#039;t do the same thing twice, rather have some else to do it - and it better be someone not complaining…

Jenkins (https://jenkins-ci.org/) can be your new team member and do all the boring stuff for you, as many times as you like - he will never complain - unless you want him to :)

Learn how essential Continuous Integration is for every project and how easy it is to setup your own CI server - but be warned: you might get addicted to automation…

…and it will make your Software more stable and reliable.

Although the talk and examples are based on the experiences with Jenkins, the basic concepts of CI do not depend on Jenkins.

Whether you use Maven, Ant, Make, Xcode or a simple script - it can easily be integrated and gives you lots of more options.

I will go through a step by step demo on how to setup a project. Having the base set, I&#039;ll show how easy it is to turn it into a distributed build environment and show some

advanced usage scenarios and plugins to take it even further:

e.g. parametrized builds, different schedule and trigger strategies, build reports, testing…</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>&quot;If it hurts, do it more often&quot;... CI is nothing magic, but one has to know some basic concepts behind. Constantly integrating your work will free you from lots of pain and with Jenkins
its just as easy as as it can get. Jenkins does not force you to use any specific tools and therefore makes it easy to get even more out of your current setup. 
…today every single SW project should be doing Continuous Integration - not doing so, just means you don&#039;t care about stable code.

  <abstract>Eclipse Scout [1] is a mature Java/Eclipse framework for developing service oriented business applications. Scout covers most repeating aspects of building user friendly applications, from the client user interface to the related services on the server side.

In a way, Scout is a NetBeans for Eclipse without the need to decide either for SWT or Swing. Scout covers both. With the Eclipse Juno release train, Scout adds support for building web applications based on the Eclipse RAP project.

Without the need to write explicit SWT/Swing/JavaScript user interface code Scout developers implement multi-frontend business applications that run on the desktop, in the web, on tablets and mobiles using a single code base. This substantially reduces the effort to build and maintain such applications. At the same time, a lock-in into a specific user interface technology is avoided.

This talk first provides a brief history and introduction into Scout. The main focus of the talk is demoing the creation of a small but complete Scout multi tier application with a client running on the desktop in the web and on a tablet.

  <title>Model driven-development of DSLs and generators</title>
  <keywords>Domain specific language, generator, model-driven development</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.7. Behavior Driven Development, Specification By Example</topics>
  <abstract>A common approach to solve similar tasks or to create variants of a product or function is “copy-paste-adapt”. But the more variants have to be built and maintained the more error-prone, tedious and time consuming this approach gets. A more sophisticated way is therefore the usage of domain specific languages (DSLs) and generators.

DSLs and generators are the main techniques to ensure the advantages of model-driven development. But even though DSLs and generators are software themselves most, approaches for their development do not apply model-driven techniques. The result is that the development of DSLs and generators is somehow a hermetism which efforts a lot of experience.

In contrast to others we propose to utilize model-driven techniques for the development of DSLs and language-independent generators. We use a meta model to describe the variant parts of the application domain. Patterns specify the generator and are derived from existing code (fragments) which get bound to the meta model, thus the specification of the generator is based on usage proven implementations. Also the DSL is specified by patterns which are linked to the meta model. Meta model and patterns contain all necessary information – including navigation - to automatically create DSL and generator. The resulting DSL is represented as a form, similar to an electronic order form, which is easy to handle. As a result no time intensive familiarisation process is necessary even for non-experts.

We implemented the approach in our tool HyperSenses which we successfully used for generation of webpages, and thousands of service adapters and large SQL-applications. HT Applications used our tool to build mobile apps. HyperSenses can be used as standalone product as well as Eclipse plugin.</abstract>

Three years ago, Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) –the result of combining several proven best practices- emerged as an architectural pattern to address these problems.

In this talk, Allard will explain how CQRS based architectures address not only concurrency and scalability problems, but also how this pattern supports the developers’ everlasting battle against complexity. He will also introduce the Axon Framework, a (Java) framework that helps in the implementation of a CQRS based architecture.

  <paper_external_comment>Background:
Applications are often based on a layered architecture, where different (technical) responsibilities are spread over layers. The domain model objects are often used across these layers, where each layer applies certain logic to those objects. The result is often that domain logic doesn’t end up where it belongs, but either in complex queries in the persistence layer. Numerous applications even put the domain logic in the user itself!

The layered architecture fails in addressing the different non-functional requirements to for example the commands versus the queries in an application. Both operations generally flow through the same components and layers.

CQRS addresses exactly that problem: it distinguishes between the Commands, operations that make changes in an application’s state, and Queries, operations that provide information about an application’s state. This makes it possible to address the different non-functional requirements for these components in different ways. When combined with an Event Driven Architecture and optionally also Event Sourcing, CQRS becomes a very powerful tool in addressing scalability and extensibility issues.

Developers should be able to focus on specific business requirements, instead of the plumbing and configuration of a (distributed) architecture. To help with that, Axon Framework provides the building blocks commonly used in this type of architecture, relieving developers from that burden.

Target audience:  Developers, Architects and Technical Managers, or anyone interested in a practical view on CQRS. Although Axon Framework targets the Java community, the core concepts are applicable to all programming languages.
Level:  Intermediate
Prerequisites: A general understanding of software architecture. Knowledge of domain modeling and/or Domain Driven Design is an advantage.

  <abstract>Since its inception just a few years ago, Android has taken the smartphone market by storm and pushed past both Apple and Nokia to take its place as the world’s number one mobile operating system. In the high-growth tablet market Android is also expected to play an important if not leading role. Android is already found within TVs, media players and watches – and in the future - who knows it may even be in your car? This presentation introduces AMG Performance Media the new Android based on-board system used in Mercedes-AMG sports vehicles. After several years of development AMG Performance Media made its public debut in 2011 inside Mercedes’ flagship SLS AMG Roadster and Coupé. The system provides access to telemetry data, multimedia and high-speed mobile Internet. Inspired by motor racing, additional functionality includes lateral and linear acceleration and race performance analysis.

Noser Engineering AG is a founding member of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) and core contributor with Google to the Android Core Libraries and Compatibility Test Suite (CTS). And most recently, together with AMG, Noser Engineering AG developed AMG Performance Media.

  <abstract>Profiling is important. We all know that premature optimization should be avoided, focusing on the slow parts. typical profiling tools have a couple of problems though. They make your application horribly slow and cannot be used on a production system. We will show how Geomajas profiling project, a simple Spring AOP based library, allows you to profile targeted pieces of your application without intrusion and with minimal impact on your application.

  <title>SOA the Red Hat way - Applying JBoss SOA Platform</title>
  <keywords>JBoss, SOA, Platform, ESB</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB</topics>
  <abstract>The acronym SOA has been used so much the last decade that some people can&#039;t stand it anymore. Like it or not, SOA has come to stay. For some companies SOA has been the way of strategically implement their IT systems. Those who have been convinced about the benefits of SOA might however be put-off by the heavy price tag of a commercial SOA product stack. Isn’t there a low-cost alternative to Oracle, IBM and Microsoft products? Of course, there are! In such a case it becomes interesting to see what open source alternatives there are. An obvious candidate for a SOA product stack would be the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform from Red Hat, the biggest player on the market for open source software. Red Hat has quite a big product stack of which you can combine several products into building a SOA system. So how could it look like? Can it keep up to commercial players in the market?

This talk is about the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform and what products and frameworks it contains. I will present how you can use the different parts together in order to build a SOA system. It will not go deep on a technical level but focus on a high level perspective, suitable for developer and architects alike. The talk won’t be a sales pitch for Red Hat and their products. For their SOA platform, Red Hat has coined the motto: SOA – Simple Open and Affordable. I will challenge this and give my opinion about it strengths and weaknesses.

The conclusions presented are based on over 1.5 years of practical experience with the JBoss SOA Platform in an ongoing SOA project.

  <title>Clean code using AOP, dependency injection &amp; Co.</title>
  <keywords>AOP, depdency injection, context-aware data, clean code</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc), 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>By their nature, business applications are complex. Developers therefore seem to accept that code turns out complicated as well. In consequence, simple architectural patterns degrade; interface methods get spilled with additional parameters, and unit testing becomes painful or is completely omitted.

In this talk we demonstrate how aspect oriented programming, dependency injection and thread local variables can be combined to solve a hard data management problem in a light-weight fashion, keeping architecture intact and promoting clean code.

The presented sample application is targeted at making domain objects context-aware, i.e. business data can be stored to logically separated domains. Read-access can combine data from several contexts, and snapshots of contextual data can be produced at any time. The application employs classical three-tier architecture in a multi-tenancy web application environment based on Spring and Hibernate. Through use of aspects, dependency injection, and thread local variables, data is read from and stored to the appropriate context without any adaptation of the user interface, service or data access object code.

This approach could be beneficial to a variety of data-centric business applications. It is currently productive in a large banking application.

In this talk we demonstrate how aspect oriented programming, dependency injection and thread local variables can be combined to solve a hard data management problem in a light-weight fashion, keeping architecture intact and promoting clean code.

The presented sample application is targeted at making domain objects context-aware, i.e. business data can be stored to logically separated domains. Read-access can combine data from several contexts, and snapshots of contextual data can be produced at any time. The application employs classical three-tier architecture in a multi-tenancy web application environment based on Spring and Hibernate. Through use of aspects, dependency injection, and thread local variables, data is read from and stored to the appropriate context without any adaptation of the user interface, service or data access object code.

This approach could be beneficial to a variety of data-centric business applications. It is currently productive in a large banking application.</abstract_plain>

  <abstract>Advanced Integration Challenges solved with Apache Camel

With it&#039;s support for the Enterprise Integration Patterns and the multiple components for integration-challenges, Apache Camel has grown into a powerful tool.

Apache Camel is the Integration Framework for the pragmatic choice and you don&#039;t even need to think of a full grown ESB every time when it comes to Application Integration.

After a short introduction into the &quot;Philosophy of the Camels&quot; we are going to take a look at some advanced challenges in which using Apache Camel shows it&#039;s strength.

To mention only a few of the examples, we will take a look at creating a Distributed System following the Command Query Responsibility Segregation Pattern (CQRS) or the creation of a simple Monitoring functionality for your Java-Application.

  <paper_external_comment>The proposed session gives a short introduction into the Apache Camel-Framework. The main focus of this session is to show pragmatic use cases where an Integration Framework is a good choice, not only when you think of Enterprise Application Integration or even ESBs. Main Goal is to show some advanced examples for any situation in the life of an integration developer or architect.</paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>JavaFX is an environment for building rich client applications. Using a scenegraph at its core and providing many advanced features, e.g. effects, animations, media-support, it greatly simplifies the task of implementing expressive user interfaces with engaging user experience. The API is entirely provided as a Java API making it also available for other programming languages that run on top of the JVM.

This talk focuses on functionality in JavaFX, that is usually most interesting for business application developers, e.g. working with the SceneBuilder for rapid UI development, using layouts, UI controls with data-binding, CSS styling, and FXML. All concepts will be explained and demoed using a JavaFX client for a JavaEE 6 application.

After this talk you will have a good idea of how JavaFX can help you write more compelling user interfaces for your business applications efficiently.</abstract>

JavaScript, jQuery and HTML5/CSS3 is the future - big companies in the IT industry are focusing on this technology stack for their future activities.

One thing that is often neglected is the separation of UI and application logic - it&#039;s very simple to modify the UI with jQuery and JavaScript, but often

the code is not unit testable anymore, cause the application logic is not separated from the UI.

Here helps the JavaScript model binding framework Knockout - with Knockout the JavaScript logic acts on a prior defined ViewModel, the JavaScript code is more decoupled and UnitTestable.

This talk gives a short introduction about JavaScript, jQuery and HTML5 and explains then the KnockoutJS framework. In a demonstration it&#039;s shown

how to create a ViewModel in JavaScript and then bind it with Knockout to the UI.

After this the JavaScript code is easy unit testable - in a short demo it&#039;s shown how to write a UnitTest with the JavaScript Test framework QUnit.

The explained technology stack can be used in combination with a given server webframework (e.g. JSF) or standalone, it&#039;s explained when it makes sense to combine it with server framework or use it completely technology independent.

The talk is based on experience in a global project with a high defined JavaScript TestCoverage rule.

  <abstract>Agile practices always sound convincing … in theory. But does it work in reality, with your huge and old software project going on for ten years or more?

The answer can be: YES!

Löwenfels has practiced this during the last 8 years. Metrics prove that code quality and efficiency are rising. How come?

Testability in such an environment is key to having success. We will show you not only tools to facilitate automatic tests but also patterns that helped us keep our tests clean. You will even learn how to make test-data travel in time.

How do you keep your developers know-how up to date in the face of time pressure and limited resources? And what about the programmers from the good old days, who know how the cookie crumbles, but are unwilling to learn new techniques? Their business knowledge is very valuable for the company, but how do you bring them into the boat? Upfront teaching is not doing the trick. We will present concrete strategies on how we improved our training by using multiple well adapted channels.

Blaming old code is easy, but is the newly written code really better? How do you make sure that your code improves and how do you measure it? TDD, pair programming and code reviews are the remedy against bad code, but how do you successfully apply them in your environment for maximum benefits. You will hear how we implemented these methods in our company.

Maybe your most important takeaway will be: How to motivate your whole organization - from engineers to upper management to customers - to actively support and push a process of continuous improvement?

We do not intend to share with you lofty visions or general ways of doing things. Instead you will be shown our concrete solution to problems that might well exist in your own development environment.

Our target audience is: Project or product development managers, experienced software developers and team leaders

Level: Advanced

Prerequisites required of attendees are: Knowledge of Agile software development and Scrum.</abstract>

  <title>REST data standardized across platforms with OData</title>
  <keywords>REST, Integration, Enterprise, Compatibility</keywords>
  <topics>2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB</topics>
  <abstract>Target Audience: Developers, Architects

Level: Intermediate

Prerequisites: software development experience

REST services are very popular. Every technology provides an API to create a REST service, starting from database and ending at high level

programming frameworks. REST is standardized on the API action level: read, create, update, delete are standardized over the HTTP protocol, also the endpoints are well described with common design pattern (good design to define a resource).

But the question is: Is the data standardized ? In SOAP you have XML schemas and WSDL files. In SOAP you know which dataelement is which type (integer, string, float...) and you can ask ad hoc the structure of the webservice via WSDL.

In REST you have the problem that the client must interpret the response from the webservice, the client must know that a returned integer is an integer - the client logic is not really loosed coupled to the service implementation - a basic service principle is not covered (from Thomas Erl -SOA principles): Self describing services.

To do the same in REST the OData specification jumps in - original started from Microsoft there exists many framework for each programming language to produce and consume OData - the specification is open, it&#039;s also possible to produce and consume OData by hand. OData provides a metadata capability, you can ask the service about

the contract - and OData is 100% REST conform.

In addition OData provides a flexible Query language on the URI level, it&#039;s possible to define specific queries to get specific data.

This talk demonstrates the core idea of OData and explains the main advantages -- it&#039;s shown how easy it is to produce and consume data over JSON / AtomPub in Java and also how to consume data which is produced from a different technology stack like .NET.

The talk is based on experience in a global project, where an OData service is created in .NET and the data is consumed in Java via automatic proxy generation and the Java restlet framework.

But the question is: Is the data standardized ? In SOAP you have XML schemas and WSDL files. In SOAP you know which dataelement is which type (integer, string, float...) and you can ask ad hoc the structure of the webservice via WSDL.

In REST you have the problem that the client must interpret the response from the webservice, the client must know that a returned integer is an integer - the client logic is not really loosed coupled to the service implementation - a basic service principle is not covered (from Thomas Erl -SOA principles): Self describing services.

To do the same in REST the OData specification jumps in - original started from Microsoft there exists many framework for each programming language to produce and consume OData - the specification is open, it&#039;s also possible to produce and consume OData by hand. OData provides a metadata capability, you can ask the service about

the contract - and OData is 100% REST conform.

In addition OData provides a flexible Query language on the URI level, it&#039;s possible to define specific queries to get specific data.

This talk demonstrates the core idea of OData and explains the main advantages -- it&#039;s shown how easy it is to produce and consume data over JSON / AtomPub in Java and also how to consume data which is produced from a different technology stack like .NET.

The talk is based on experience in a global project, where an OData service is created in .NET and the data is consumed in Java via automatic proxy generation and the Java restlet framework.

  <title>Extreme feedback device for Continuous integration</title>
  <keywords>Agile, Continuous Integration, Fun</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.6. Build Management, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Target Audience: Developers, Architects, ProjectManagers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites: Understanding in agile principles

Continuous Integration servers are very common and powerful systems to give the team early feedback about the current state of the software.

If the team gets early feedback about the stability and integrity of the software system, the team is able to do quality work from the beginning

and during the whole project lifecycle.

The Continuous Integration system is an obligation for the team to keep the system running and consistent, because everbody can see and track

what the current state of the system is - to make it short: it&#039;s one of the key element in agile engineering principles.

Many CI systems sending Emails if the central build breaks or specific quality metrics are violated - the problem in our experience was that

this emails was too often ignored, they are getting lost in the daily mail occurrence - also messages on the screen are often overseen.

Here helps an Extreme Feedback device, if the CI build or job is broken, a red light is turning on; everybody sees immediately: The build/deployment is broken - fixing has now 100% priority. If the green light is on, everything is ok: Build is ok, UnitTests are ok, Continuous Deployment is ok, and so on...

The team is motivated - the fun part increases.

This talk gives a short overview about a done ExtremeFeedback device with the Hudson/Jenkins CI Server. The needed Hardware and software is explained, also which interface Hudson/Jenkins provides to write a custom tiny software to trigger the hardware over an bluetooth power device.

Following advantages are illustrated:
- Never loose the focus to the Continuous Integration system, make it more feelable !
- The whole team with all stakeholders see the current state =&gt; Transparency
- Bring fun to the team - this is something new for the daily routine !

  <paper_external_comment>--- About the Session ---

This session explains, what Agile Management Innovovations are, why they are so rewarding, and how one can use them in one’s own organization. I’ll bring plenty of examples from very different companies like Google, Whole Foods, Gore, IBM, Best Buy and
Semco. I’ll also report (anonymously) about customers, where I supported in organizational changes on management level with Agile principles. In addition I’ll talk about my own company, where we discuss and use Agile Management Innovations. I’ll give lots of concrete examples, like
- Slack
- Visualization
- Pull
- Happiness-Index
- Open Space
- Slow Time
- Reverse Accountability
- Konsent
- and many more.

In this session I’ll use lots of picture material and stories, as well as a few interactive elements.

--- Outline ---

I’ve planned the following structure:
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation
- Theory X and theory Y by Douglas McGregor
- Motivation through autonomy, mastery, purpose by Dan Pink
- Consequences of Agile Management Innovations
- Introduction
- Resistence
- Benefits
- Copycatting

--- What’s in it for the audience? ---

Especially in the area of Agile Management Innovations it’s not about serving easily consumable bits, but about to stoke up passion and desire to invent own recipies. I want to show the audience, how they can be Agile Management Innovators within their own organizations, and how they can gain huge benefits from doing so.

--- References ---

I did a previous version of this session at the Lean Kanban Central Europe conference (LKCE) 2011 in Munich, Germany (see http://bit.ly/vzswuA ) and at the OOP conference 2012, also in Munich, Germany (see http://bit.ly/AxlGMf ). The session at Lean Kanban Central Europe has been voted to one of the best ones on this conference (I’m waiting for the OOP feedback at the moment). Future versions of this session are accepted, Goto Conference Copenhagen 2012 (Denmark), Goto Conference Amsterdam 2012 (Netherlands), and SEACON 2012 in Hamburg, Germany.</paper_external_comment>

  <title>Needle - Effective Unit Testing for Jaava EE</title>
  <keywords>Unit Testing, Injection, Java EE, Mock Object</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>Writing good concise tests for application components can be quite cumbersome. They may have a lot of dependencies to other beans and you do not want to manually write mock objects to fulfil all of them. On the other hand you do not want to run too many slow integration tests.

We still see the need for a lightweight framework that allows to test components in isolation where their dependencies are resolved in an arbitrary manner.

Sometimes you might want to use mock objects for dependencies, sometimes you would like to link your component to the real worlds.

With the Needle framework you can accomplish those goals in very comfortable way. Objects under test will get their dependencies injected

automatically. You are free to supply implementations yourself or rely on the mock objects provided by Needle. Needle will thus minimize the setup code and maximize the speed of a unit test.

We have been developing and extending Needle over a period of years using it extensively in our projects.

The Needle core is extensible, it allows you to add your own injection points at run time. There are already modules to support Seam 2,

where a module with Seam 3 support is currently under development.

The session will cover the core features and flexibility of Needle and show you how easy it is to write unit test with Needle.</abstract>

  <abstract>Kotlin is a modern statically typed general-purpose language designed to be safe, concise, expressive and 100% Java-compatible. It is developed by JetBrains (creators of IntelliJ IDEA) and distributed under the Apache 2 License. Kotlin is compiled to Java byte code as well as JavaScript, so it can run on both client- and server-side.

This session gives an overview of the key features of Kotlin and demonstrates how the new language integrates into the existing infrastructure: from libraries to the IDE and build tools. On top of that we show how one can make Java APIs better using Kotlin, without having to alter them in any way.

The session open with an overview of the language that includes:

* Classes and primary constructors

* Extension functions

* Higher-order functions

* Null-safety and smart casts

After the overview, we demonstrate how to use Kotlin to enhance Java APIs:

* Kotlin’s extensions turn standard JDK collections into fluent data structures that can be processed in the spirit of LINQ.

* Even Swing control layout can be turned into a nice declarative code by type-safe builders implemented in Kotlin.

We conclude with a short IDE demo to show Kotlin in action.

  <abstract>Imagine a rich client application that has been developed for more than 15 years. The application is highly configurable and used in many countries. The development process is based on Scrum, but testing is mainly a manual task. Many efforts have been made to automate at least UI tests but the capture and replay approach didn&#039;t pay off. But due to the increasing number of developers and teams, test automation is perceived as essential.

In order to achieve stable, flexible and maintainable tests, technical details must be excluded from the tests. Our approach was to make use of so called page objects where each window, form, etc. is represented by a Java object that encapsulates all technical details. These 1.800 page objects consisting of 20.000 controls are automatically generated from plain text files coming from Visual Studio. This was achieved by writing a grammar in Xtext and interpreting the model. Multilingual user interfaces and text strings are abstracted by the page object. But most importantly, tests are not coded, they are written in a behaviour driven approach. Testers and product owners describe the expected behaviour in a textual manner and these steps are mapped to coded steps and workflows that encapsulate the interaction with the application. The textual scenario can immediately be executed as a repeatable UI test.

In this session we will see how all of this works together and runs in a Continous Integration environment.</abstract>

  <title>Deploying trusted dev sandboxes in Amazon&#039;s cloud</title>
  <keywords>cloud, security, devops</keywords>
  <topics>1.5. PaaS/Security, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 7.2. Security, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>As the economics and reliability of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in the cloud becomes more enticing, new collaborative computing models emerge. The European Space Agency&#039;s Earth Observation division is completing an operational pilot to offer easier access to its very large set of high resolution satellite imagery free of charge to end users who develop applications which use this data.

Distributing the entire dataset is not feasible because it is so large (i.e. costly to distribute) and periodically being reprocessed with the latest correction and enhancement algorithms. Up until now, subsets of data have been distributed on cheap media. This allowed some degree of development and testing but many applications only really become interesting when they have access to much larger sets of data.

The cloud offers a new possibility: put all of the data securely in the cloud and let developers remotely develop their applications in cloud-based compute sandboxes &quot;close to the data&quot;.

There have been many successful examples of remote desktop software development in the cloud, but this situation adds a further difficulty. Some users (i.e. application developers) consider their applications to be trade secrets (or even government secrets). And the agency is historically known not to place high importance on keeping and guarding such secrets.

This talk will describe the development of an automated trusted remote Java development sandbox hosted (as a prototype) in the Amazon cloud that uses strong encryption for system authentication and filesystem services, which gives discerning users confidence that their applications&#039; intellectual property won&#039;t be compromised while at the same time not needing to trust the deployers or operators of the cloud-based sandbox service.</abstract>
  <abstract_plain>As the economics and reliability of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in the cloud becomes more enticing, new collaborative computing models emerge. The European Space Agency&#039;s Earth Observation division is completing an operational pilot to offer easier access to its very large set of high resolution satellite imagery free of charge to end users who develop applications which use this data.

Distributing the entire dataset is not feasible because it is so large (i.e. costly to distribute) and periodically being reprocessed with the latest correction and enhancement algorithms. Up until now, subsets of data have been distributed on cheap media. This allowed some degree of development and testing but many applications only really become interesting when they have access to much larger sets of data.

The cloud offers a new possibility: put all of the data securely in the cloud and let developers remotely develop their applications in cloud-based compute sandboxes &quot;close to the data&quot;.

  <abstract>We all face a challenge of a 40 years long career, it is a biological fact we cannot change. In this time we use a few programming paradigms, about ten major languages, innumerable frameworks. I have programmed the first microprocessors in assembler using punched tape, in the Java world I am still active. We do not know how will our profession look like in 2040, but for sure it will be different.

The important factors are:

• technology development – still exponential growth or saturation

• tools – silver bullet found or manual programming needed

• demographic situation – old programmer vs. young programmers

• global market – outsourcing or local development

You have to learn a lot, but more important – you have to make your career evolve, changing positions and tasks. Will you still code when over 50? If not, what will you do, what new skills will you develop?

The world around you will change, so you better be prepared. Plan early the next stage of your career, let the new tasks match the experience you have gained. Make it credible to your employer, old or new, that you are ready for the new challenges.

  <title>Real-Time collaboration for Beginners – A Workshop</title>
  <keywords>Real-Time Collaboration</keywords>
  <topics>8.2. Experiments, 8.3. Entertainment, Gaming</topics>
  <abstract>Software development is not a production process but a collective creative process. Analogies would be improvisation theatre, team sports or the behaviour of socially living animals. The “collective” aspect of software development is not only about arranging duties and solving integration problems. The key part is distributing and sharing information and making individual knowledge available to all team members.

Traditional approaches are asynchronous, rendering the team a set of individuals rather than a whole complete in itself as it is demanded by the agile philosophy. The step beyond is real-time collaboration: common synchronous crafting on the same artefacts by several individuals. Changes are distributed instantly; the artefact itself becomes an additional communication channel.

This workshop is designed to give people a real feel for the different style of work without need for knowledge of specific software technologies or development approaches. We will give teams a task to accomplish together using Google Docs. You only need to bring a laptop that can run Google Docs.</abstract>

  <title>CDI Extensions: From Zero to Hero</title>
  <keywords>jee, cdi, arquillian, seam</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks</topics>
  <abstract>CDI has proven to be one of the most ground breaking additions to Java EE 6. Part of this success is not only the state-of-the-art programming model, but also the ability to enrich the platform with features not covered by the specification. Those features are portable and appear seamlessly integrated into the container - like routing CDI events to JMS or simplifying unhandy Java EE APIs like JavaMail. Only your imagination is the limit.

In this interactive session you will get an introduction to the basic yet powerful mechanisms that allow you to change the Java platform by simply adding a JAR file to the classpath. We will first show you how CDI enables extensions during the container lifecycle, then we will continue by adding our own custom injectable beans, changing dependency injection points and bean meta data up to advanced topics like creating custom scopes. Combining theory and live coding, you will discover how CDI extensions can be efficiently tested using the Arquillian testing framework.

To round off the presentation you’ll also get a tour of common CDI extensions like Seam 3 or the most recent Apache DeltaSpike.</abstract>

  <abstract>Warning Signs for Requirements - On Trying to Measure the Quality of Requirements...

Requirements specifications must be of sufficient quality, as they are the foundation for further work in the project. Misunderstandings in this early phase of a project have drastic consequences for nearly all subsequent activities in regards of costs and quality. Therefore, you have to be able to define and assess the quality of requirements and of a specification without any doubt. However, what is the best way to do so? Particularly for specifications that consist of natural-language requirements, it seems difficult to make a definite statement about their unambiguousness, consistency, identifiability or necessity.

Exactly this problem is solved by an approach that packs the quality of natural-language requirements into metrics and focuses on linguistic at the same time. This lecture addresses the following questions and offers possible solutions:
- How can the quality of a requirement be measured?
- Which metrics exist in this field and which target values are good?
- Which sample sizes make sense for specifications?
- Do I have to measure and assess different types of requirements (e. g. non-functional requirements, general requirements) differently?
- How to introduce an approach based on metrics in a company?

Using specific examples, solutions will be presented and discussed in an argumentative manner. </abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Requirements are the basis of system development. Insufficient quality of requirements endangers the outcome of development projects. To prevent projects from being started on an erroneous basis, quality metrics for  requirements can be applied. Measuring natural-language requirements in regards of e. g. unambiguitiy or consistency is a valuable means of quality assurance and a possibility to asses a project&#039;s progress.</paper_external_comment>

  <abstract>Having software developed offshore has become a common concept. It requires communicating requirements from client to contractor who usually speak different languages. The client can either write their requirements specification document in English right away or they can write it in their native language and have it translated.

In this talk we will look at the advantages and disadvantages of both variants and answer the following questions:

How can I write an understandable requirements specification document, even if my English isn’t the best? Which means can help me and how do I use them efficiently? What do I have to take into consideration when having a requirements specification document translated? How can I influence the quality of that translation?</abstract>

  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>One common complaint you hear a lot about Java EE 6 development is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie, it takes a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is very difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integration testing can be a huge challenge.

Luckily two recent additions to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-oriented testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real target runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly, JBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set up JSF, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian, it all becomes a real breeze.

Attend this session to learn how to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used to rapidly create, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. They truly will turn out to be the missing links you have been looking for in Java EE 6 Development.

  <abstract_plain>One common complaint you hear a lot about Java EE 6 development is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie, it takes a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is very difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integration testing can be a huge challenge.

  <title>Plugging into JBoss Forge</title>
  <keywords>RAD, Java EE</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins</topics>
  <abstract>JBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set up JSF, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian, it all becomes a real breeze.

But what to do when the functionality you need is not available in Forge? Not to worry, as Forge operates by means of plug-ins, the answer is to just create your own plug-in with the functionality you need and install it into Forge.

This session is a deep dive into JBoss Forge plug-in development in which we will show you exactly how to do this. We will give a detailed explanation about the most relevant APIs as well as a demonstration of the creation of such a plug-in.

  <keywords>IPv4, IPv6, Java, DNS</keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 7.2. Security, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>2011 is the year that all IPv4 addresses became exhausted. IPv6 support is no longer a &quot;nice-to-have&quot;, and as Engineers we will all be tasked to support this protocol within our systems and applications. Compliance is not limited to hardware and OS tiers, but also affects the entire software stack including server-side and client-side Java. This session covers everything you will need to know to fully support IPv6 for your application, including:

• Everything you need to know about Java&#039;s built-in support for IPv6

• Programming gotcha&#039;s related to parsing, data structures, data storage and more

• Domain name and DNS strategies to test, support and migrate clients and services

• IPv6 Dual-stack networking support for IPv4 and IPv6

  <keywords>Modular, OSGi, pattern, architecture</keywords>
  <topics>1.2. Java Containers, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Modularity is a characteristic of software that is important for the evolution of software systems and adaptability to new requirements. Similar to usual design patterns, there are modularity patterns to achieve modular software.

Today software is usually developed in projects. In the first version the system or application fulfills all requirements, but over the time new requirements require changing or extending the existing software. If the software is done as a monolithic block, the side effects of a change are too much to allow further development of a system.

The presentation focuses on the modularity patterns to achieve modular software like:
- Module definition
- Interface of modules (Façade)
- Layers of systems and module interfaces of layers
- Dependency injection
- Replacement of modules (Liskov principle)
- and many more…

The patterns are explained in a small example, implemented in OSGi.</abstract>

  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches</topics>
  <abstract>Target Audience: Developers, Architects, ProjectManagers

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites: -

An agile process like Scrum provides a solid and easy framework to live an agile process. In addition to scrum it&#039;s very important

for developers to live some basic agile engineering principles. This talk gives an short overview about the most important

agile engineering principles for developers.

Following skills and practices will be explained:
- Continuous Integration/Deployment/Delivery
- Clean Code - what is clean code? Examples of bad code design.
- Team thinking - Important requirements and communication skills
- Boyscout Rule - Collective code ownership
- Continuous Learning - get out of the comfort zone
- Give early feedback - feedback to team and stakeholders
- Test Driven Development - Benefits
- Contribute to an emergent architecture - the team is the architect
- Continuous Refactoring - Make it to an daily practice
- Effective Communication
- Develop and test - Code and testing belongs together
- Spread knowledge - don&#039;t be a knowledge silo
- Lean thinking - Avoid unnecessary work

Every point is shortly discussed and explained what the benefits are. These agile developer skills are one key element

to bring the agile process to success.

The explained points are basing on experience from local and global ScrumTeams.

  <title>Improving system development using traceability</title>
  <keywords>Requirements Traceability, Impact Analysis, Coverage Analysis</keywords>
  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>During the development of complex systems many different artifacts such as requirements specifications, architecture specifications, software units, test specifications or test cases need to be created and maintained. Due to the complexity of the systems it is no longer possible for single engineers to keep an overview over all these artifacts on all levels of detail. Typical questions are:

• Is it still possible to accept a late change request? What would be the impact?

• What is the overall level of completion of the system or a component?

• Which components are ready for testing?

• A failure occurs because the system is erroneous. What parts of the system should I check?

In order to be able to answer these questions it is important do be able to follow the life of each requirement in both directions, i.e. from specification, via architecture to code and test and vice versa. Bi-directional traceability is identified as a good practice for improving the quality within system and software development and is thus required by process standards such as SPICE, CMMI and ISO 26262.

This talk provides methodological guidelines for adding traceability to existing tool chains and proposes an implementation based on open source frameworks.</abstract>

  <title>No crash allowed - patterns for fault tolerance</title>
  <keywords>patterns, fault tolerance, architecture, design, high availability</keywords>
  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>Fault tolerance requires a much higher attention in big, highly scalable (cloud) systems than in standard enterprise applications. Out-of-the-box HA solutions won&#039;t scale beyond a given limit or they just become way to expensive. It&#039;s also no option to rely solely on standard application monitoring if you&#039;re running a massively distributed system. But system failures on a regular basis aren&#039;t acceptable, either.

As a consequence we have to build fault tolerance explicitly into our applications. But, how are we supposed to do that? We relied on ready-to-run cluster and HA solutions for so long that we completely lost the knowledge how to implement it. Lately, we started to hear a bit about &quot;let it crash&quot; from Erlang here and there, but that&#039;s just a starting point and by far not sufficient.

Within this session I&#039;d like to discuss a bit about the basic concepts of fault tolerant applications and present several alternative and complimentary patterns that you might use to build fault tolerance into your applications. We&#039;ll also be talking about tradeoffs for the patterns, hands-on decision support and design ideas for turning the patterns into code.

As so often we&#039;ll just be able to scratch the surface of this topic within a sessions time span, but you&#039;ll get several alternative ideas and concepts at hand that might be valuable for you and your next project - not only within big cloud systems.

We&#039;ll also be talking about tradeoffs for the patterns, hands-on decision support and design ideas for turning the patterns into code.

As so often we&#039;ll just be able to scratch the surface of this topic within a sessions time span, but you&#039;ll get several alternative ideas and concepts at hand that might be valuable for you and your next project - not only within big cloud systems.</abstract_plain>

  <keywords>high scalability, patterns, architecture, design, cloud</keywords>
  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>Highly scalable applications are different. The well known priciples of business application architectures aren&#039;t valid anymore in those areas. Many concepts we take for granted can&#039;t be used for highly scalable systems. As a consequence we have to rethink most architectural decisions from scratch and will end up with very different solutions.

Within this session I&#039;d like to discuss the basic dimensions of high scalability and its consequences for application design a bit. Based on that i&#039;d like to present several alternative and complimentary patterns that you might use to build highly scalable applications. We&#039;ll also be talking about tradeoffs for the patterns, hands-on decision support and design ideas for turning the patterns into code.

  <title>The Pros and Cons of Emergent Architecture Design</title>
  <keywords>emergent architecture, agile, system changeability, responsibilities of architecture</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy</topics>
  <abstract>Within the agile community there are a lot of almost religious discussions about emergent architecture. The agile evangelists claim we (almost) don&#039;t need conventional architectural design at all. Instead architecture - besides a bit of architectural vision in the beginning - emerges solely within a repeating cycle of feature implementation and refactorings. According to the evangelists this approach automatically leads to the simplest and therefore optimal architecture.

Sorry, but it&#039;s not that easy!

This point of view neglects crucial responsibilities of architecture. If you take a look at the software quality attributes - that architecture is responsible for - you may split them up in three different function areas that each require fundamental different approaches:
- Non-functional features: Design and implementation of the non-functional requirements, i.e. security or reliability features
- Complexity management: Due to the limitations of the human brain we need to organize the myriad of details within a software system in a way that the people who need to work with the system easily understand the structure of the system. That way people can find the details currently relevant for them quickly, which preserves their capability to work with the system.
- Changeability: A software needs to be open for modification and new features. That means to organize the software in a fashion that most of the future change requests can be implemented in an as simple as possible way.

Especially the first and the third area are core responsibilities of architectural work, but the emergence approach of the agile evangelists basically only covers the second responsibility - which is a huge problem because today changeability is probably the most important requirement concerning software due to the immense change pressure from business.

In short words: Emergence is not sufficient!

Starting form this insight I&#039;d like to discuss the pros and cons of emergent architectural design in this session, what it&#039;s good for, what&#039;s missing and what else you need to add to meet the requirements of architecture as a whole.</abstract>

  <title>Graph Database Modelling with Neo4j - A Case Study</title>
  <keywords>Graph database, Neo4j, Java, Spring, Spring Data, Domain modelling</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Junisphere Systems AG is an IT solutions provider headquartered in Wallisellen, Switzerland. We provide a methodology and a software suite that helps companies to proactively manage their critical business processes and monitor their IT services end-to-end in real-time.

The underlying data model that represents the monitored business processes and IT services forms a graph. This graph structure models all dependencies between the business processes, IT services and the underlying IT infrastructure components and the data flow between them. While looking for ways to persist such a data model, we became aware of graph databases. We soon were convinced that this “new” kind of database technology would be of great help to model our domain and we decided to use Neo4j – the probably best known exponent of this kind of NoSQL databases.

Our case study shall give attendees an impression of how graph databases (especially Neo4j) can by of great use to model complex domains and which benefits but also what challenges can be expected when using this new technology. Based on our specific domain, we will give a very short introduction to graph databases (that model property graphs as Neo4j does), to Neo4j itself and to the Spring Data Neo4j library which is a convenient abstraction layer in the Spring environment. Attendees will get a feeling that graph databases are definitively more than just another NoSQL hype.

The target audiences are Java developers, software architects, database designers and anyone interested in NoSQL or alternative database technologies. Attendees should have basic knowledge in Java (Spring).

Level: intermediate

A preliminary outline of the content of the 20 minute presentation:

2 min. Short introduction to our domain

2 min. An example of an IT service model

2 min. Introduction to graph databases

4 min. Using Spring Data Neo4j as an abstraction layer

2 min. DAO layer with Spring Data repositories

3 min. Querying the graph with traversal descriptions, the cypher query language and indices

2 min. Specific domain modeling techniques we are using

1 min. Challenges with graph databases

2 min. Conclusion

  <title>Architecture Reviews uncovered</title>
  <keywords>architecture review, evaluation, ATAM, szenario, quality</keywords>
  <topics>10.3. Architecture reviews and criterias for doing so, 10.4. Dealing with technical debts in the enterprise (e.g. addressing it in a distributed setting)</topics>
  <abstract>Developing Software in medium sized or big projects always raises questions about architectural work. Based on the experience gained during architecture reviews of multiple software systems, this session provides possible answers to some of these questions: Who is responsible for developing the software architecture? How can multiple project members or even multiple teams work on architectural decisions without sacrificing conceptual integrity or boosting &quot;big design up-front&quot;-approaches? How can we ensure that the developed concepts and designs are fulfilling the quality requirements of the project as a whole? And finally, how can we ensure that these concepts are feasible and realizable within the set constraints?

Methodical and recurring execution of architecture reviews is an effective and essential step here. This session compares well known methods and practices for architecture reviews, but it does not stop there. Instead, it starts off by introducing some real life examples of architectural work, illustrating common problems and challenges. Based on these examples, the session carves out the techniques and practices that are most profitable. Not every project needs sophisticated, full blown evaluation methods like ATAM and CBAM or heavy architecture review tools, but the centrepieces of methodology behind these concepts are almost always beneficial: They improve the architecture work, help to achieve the systems quality attributes and provide transparency for the major stakeholders.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Target Audience:

software architects, senior software developers, project managers, scrum masters

Level:

Intermediate

Prerequisites:

software development project background, insight into the main challenges of software architecture work

General Topic/Problem:

As described in the abstract, the session is based on architectural review experience and tries to convey some key techniques that are applicable in almost every project and are especially helpful in organizing bigger architectural efforts with multiple teams. Theoretical background will give some context for the attendees, but the key takeaways are practical tips and smaller method-pieces that should be applicable right away and iteratively.</abstract>

  <title>You are Agile: But Productive? Cost effective?</title>
  <keywords>Agile Management, Productivity</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches, 9.4. Experiences using new approaches like DevOps or LeanStartUp, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>Agile continues to gain ground. Increasingly management is asking ”Are Agile teams more productive and cost effective?” To answer these questions the session shows the key data needed to understand the Agile non linear cost drivers and quantify Agile team process productivity. First we show expected productivity values and then 39 completed Agile projects are used to test our answers. We benchmark these Agile projects to quantify team process productivity and time pressure and demonstrate the cost consequences of both drivers. This answers the Agile management questions including comparison with “Waterfall” developments. Participants are offered the opportunity to benchmark their projects. The Agile benchmark results are used to show how informed cost effective decisions are made when constructing an Agile Time Box to determine the feature content, Sprint size and interval.

This answers the Agile management questions including comparison with “Waterfall” developments. Participants are offered the opportunity to benchmark their projects. The Agile benchmark results are used to show how informed cost effective decisions are made when constructing an Agile Time Box to determine the feature content, Sprint size and interval.</abstract_plain>

  <bibliography>Jim Greene’s software engineering career extends over 40 years initially as a project manager and then for more than 25 years as a management consultant.   He worked for IBM as a software project manager responsible for developing large commercial systems for banking and utilities as well as a real-time telecommunications product.
His software consultancy work lead to the European introduction of the quantitative Software Lifecycle Management (SLIM) techniques based on the engineering principles established by Lawrence Putnam.  Using basic metrics these techniques provide quantifiable commercial benefits to major companies responsible for software development and software acquisition. The benefits result from:
Software performance measurement quantifying process productivity including benchmarking developments against industry reference measures.  Software process improvement over time is tracked to cost justify process improvement investments and calculate ROI
Realistic software cost estimates that provide risk assessed development plans.  The estimates take in to account requirement uncertainties and are consistent with the known process productivity and development constraints.
Software governance to ensure development progress and quality is always visible.  Risks to achieving delivery on-time, within budget and at the required quality are identified using statistical process control.  Advanced techniques use progress data to forecast completion, including quality at delivery, and support earned value 
Jim’s primary interest is to enable clients to gain these benefits by introducing proven metrics and methods based on the QSM quantitative engineering measures. </bibliography>

  <paper_external_comment>As Agile gains ground, management is asking ”Are Agile teams more productive and cost effective?” By attending delegates will understand the key data needed to quantify the Agile cost drivers in particular Agile team productivity.  Participants will be equipped to understand the non-linear relationships between Agile size, time and effort - a key Agile cost driver, as well as team process productivity and time pressure.  Benchmark analysis on 39 Agile projects is shown to test and explain Agile team process productivity and highlight the cost consequences of time pressure.  This answers the Agile management questions including comparison to “Waterfall” developments. The Agile results are then used to show how  to make informed cost effective decisions when constructing an Agile Time Box consistent with team process productivity.  With this quantitative analysis managers, including  purchasing  managers negotiating contracts, are able to commit to and support Agile .</paper_external_comment>

  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 5.3. BPM, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>Starting with BPEL and continuing with BPMN2, Business Processes are executed in their own Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). The BPMS handles the execution and management of long-running process instances and the versioning of the executed process models. But due to their long running nature processes tend to survive version changes of process models as well as new versions of targeted external Web services. Therefore, adapters are needed that mediate between the different message versions.

Apache Camel provides a pragmatic way of defining the needed transformation chains that address that need in business process automation projects.

In this session, we are going to explain some of the fundamental basics of BPMN2 and Apache Camel and how to combine a BPMS with an Integration Framework to have solutions for your every day as well as strategic business process management challenges.</abstract>

  <abstract>All the day long, developers are adding, editing or even removing features from applications. The best practices of development are helping them to keep the quality of the source code as good as possible. However at the end, everybody can suffer from a single mistake in the source code which is affecting either the functionality or quality of the application. Poor performance could be one of these side effects.

Every organization has its own culture, domain of service, technologies and so on which brings a variety of processes also. But as a common concern all of them strive to reach the same goal: improving productivity and quality. Despite the variety of philosophies on how to create software, organizations often experience very similar problems. A proven solution is “Continuous Integration”, whose goal is to automate a certain number of quality checks (which can be functional and non-functional) in the development process, in order to magnify productivity and quality.

Different Continuous Integration solutions have been innovated, but they all rely on the same components: source code repository and dedicated Continuous Integration Server (CI Engine). Nowadays, more and more aspects of software quality (code style verification, code correctness, code complexity, potential bug determination) are addressed in Continuous Integration solutions.

More techniques can be integrated with CI solutions to enhance its effectiveness to a broader range: testing non-regression in performance, analyzing the source code and providing notifications of potential issues.

This talk will present the components of a Continuous Integration solution and explains how such a practice applies to all the aspects of software quality, including performance.

  <title>Use semantic technology on a web of group buying.</title>
  <keywords>E-commerce, social network, semantic web, ontology, group buying</keywords>
  <topics />
  <abstract>With the vigorous development of the network, E-Commerce become to one of the important channels for marketing and sale today. Because the data of web pages are showing exponential growth and the search engine only can use the keyword to do the comparative, people need to spend more times on data filtering and sometimes can’t find the data they want accurately. The reason of this problem is the computer cannot understand the meaning of these web contents. So, if we can let the computer to read and understand the meaning of web contents, it can help to enhance the efficiency in the use of the internet.

Therefore, this study uses the semantic web technology as a search engine infrastructure mode. We use the E-commerce social network as research field, and design a model on a 3C group buying web. Through the infrastructure, computers can automatically understand the information in the pages, and do the logical reasoning according to the pre-defined product ontology. By means of experiments, users are divided into two groups － experimental group and control group. The experimental group uses the semantic web technology as a search engine infrastructure mode, and the control group uses the keyword search architecture. Through this experiment, we want to verify the experimental group can reduce the search time and improve the search accuracy of the data than control group.</abstract>

  <abstract>We all know that Agile works great for small dedicated projects. However, only a small part of projects do fit that profile, especially in larger corporate environments. In those environments, you typically will need to add features and fixes to recently launched products, provide maintenance and support for older products until they reach their end of life and last, initiate and release new projects. This challenge has to be solved by any successful enterprise. The ‘Responding to Change over following a Plan’ thinking of the Agile Manifesto seems to contradict such an environment where big planning upfront seems to be mandatory. What a false truism! Agile is the perfect tool to combine those different types of work into regular cohesive but flexible releases.

This talk will show how a Scrum implementation based on release trains and agile portfolio management is an effective solution to a very common large enterprise problem.

  <abstract>In the last decade the Industry matured enough to develop a greater understanding of Software Quality, as the many books and articles about this subject show. However many ideas remain largely unused in real-world projects. Is it because of limited applicability, missing pragmatism in the proposed solutions or some other yet unnamed reason? Whatever that reason might be, we also learned that the best way to reach an unknown or moving target is to go step by step, and check frequently whether we moved in the right direction.

This session makes the first very important step towards establishing quality standards in Your Enterprise projects: To introduce a common vocabulary that all the people involved understand, including project managers, developers, testers and even operators. This vocabulary is based on a hierarchy of categories with metrics as leafs which have common well defined characteristics.

With this vocabulary it becomes possible to ask questions like: &quot;What is the Quality of the Software produced?&quot;, &quot;What is the Quality of our Software Systems in our Landscape?&quot; Although some of the metrics used to answer these questions might still be subjective, the questions themselves will be well defined and objective to anybody using the same vocabulary.

It enables the board of directors, executives and commitees to analyse all the different aspects of bank management in an up-to-date and compact way.

An integrated data pool collects and aggregates data from a broad range of internal and external systems and provides acces to this information. The frontend offers a modern management reporting experience with graphical elements such as signal lights, tachometer, diagrams along with classic tables.

Since the IT department of the saving banks has been consolidated to one single provider, configurability is a major design concept of the Management Cockpit to fit the needs of about 430 saving banks. The foundation is formed by a standardised pool of key figures and centrally maintained sets of standard and sample reports. On top of this, customising is possible, such as individual extensions to the data pool and modifications of existing or creating new reports.

Technologies invoved in the project include Pentaho Data Integration (ETL), Pentaho BI Suite (OLAP), Java EE, JSF. The modified version of the frontend is also available on mobile devices.

The presentation covers an introduction to the architecture and the benefits of the Management Cockpit as well as selected challenges - business and technical - and the solutions implemented.</abstract>

  <title>Source-based software specification</title>
  <keywords>software specification, agile development, source-based</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 7.8. Effective framework and library documentation</topics>
  <abstract>Keeping software documentation and specification up to date is challenging, especially in agile projects where requirements change frequently. Developers in general do not like writing documentation and tend to forget it, leading to incomplete or outright wrong software specifications.

In this talk, we present a solution to automatically generate functional software specification documents by including excerpts from Javadoc of classes and methods in an XML document structure. The solution is complemented by an Eclipse plug-in with support for refactorings and error markers.

The presented solution has the same key benefits as Javadoc-based API documentation. It keeps the documentation as close to the code as possible, and is able to automatically generate a specification document, e. g., after every sprint.

The solution has been successfully used in a banking software project.</abstract>

  <abstract>REST (Representational State Transfer) is becoming standard on the internet.

Now that JSR-311 &quot;JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services&quot; is part of J2EE6, we decided to use it within our open source Portal platform Entando, to allow the exchange of information between other external systems.

The session will start with an introduction to Entando. We will also create an example that will provide an overview of how to develop a service that publishes Open Data on multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, pc, ...)

The aim will be to show how using REST API’s &amp; Entando developers can extend the reach of a portal and its adoption in an organisation.

Entando is an open source Java based portal platform that allows developers to easily make vertical applications or develop &amp; deploy enterprise portals including rich CMS capabilities. Our commitment to remain open source &amp; our passion for opening the world of web to those with visual impairments has made us successful in government sectors &amp; we will profile some success stories of our use of REST API’s in large government deployments in Italy including the Civil protection agency &amp; the Ministry of Justice.</abstract>

  <title>OCR on Mobile Devices</title>
  <keywords>Optical Character Recognition, Android, iOS, Hybrid/Cross-Platform Development</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Android Development, 4.2. iOS Development, 4.4. Hybrid/Multiplatform Development, 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>The hardware capabilities of today&#039;s smartphones allow us to use them for computationally intensive tasks. One such task is optical character recognition (OCR). OCR enables translation of an image of written text into a machine-encoded form and thereby eliminates the need for manual retyping.

AdNovum has implemented an application for mobile devices that includes a payment slip scanner. The application was first released for the iOS platform. An Android version followed shortly afterwards.

The scanner is capable of scanning and processing paper payment slips

for the electronic payment of bills. A payment slip is scanned by taking a picture. The picture is then preprocessed and used as input to the Tesseract OCR engine, which extracts the text for the payment. All these steps are performed on a smartphone, which poses interesting challenges from a design as well as from an integration point of view.

We would like to share our experiences while developing the payment slip scanner, focusing on:

1) Scanning, including camera control and preview, focus, overlay, buttons, and picture taking.

2) Image preprocessing, including preparation of the scanned image for the Tesseract OCR engine, memory management pitfalls and approaches to improve recognition accuracy via simple and advanced algorithms.

3) The Tesseract OCR engine, including general overview, capabilities and features, integration with Java and training of the engine for a specific font.

4) Transition from iOS to Android, including differences between the two platforms that had to be taken into account.

5) Further improvements, including ideas improving overall usability and recognition accuracy of the application.

6) Demonstration of our application and conclusion with discussion about design decisions, pitfalls and lessons learned during the hybrid/cross-platform development.</abstract>

  <title>An Insight into Service Discovery Process in SOA</title>
  <keywords>Service Discovery, Service Life Cycle Management, Transformation Program, Organization Structure, SOA Governanace</keywords>
  <topics>5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>One of the largest research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in the world has initiated a Transformation Program to address a strategic goal for the Research and Development division to deliver twice the number of new products by 2015. The aim of the program is to rationalize and simplify its clinical information environment by 2014. With such a huge application base, comes the need for large integration requirements and an objective to move from point to point integration to SOA based loosely coupled, reusable and policy governed integration environment. An Integration Factory was setup to facilitate smooth transition to SOA-based integration environment, enforcing governance so that the policies are adhered to and the initiatives are sustained through the adoption of best practices, methodologies and policies leading to reduced cost and risk, better manageability of technology and skills. One of the main objectives of the Integration Factory was to define the governance processes around the service life cycle. In order to realize the expected business benefits of SOA-based integration technologies, it is very important to clearly define the processes around service discovery, development and deployment.

Out of the Service Life Cycle Governance processes, Service Discovery process is of utmost importance as in a big program like this, a variety of project risks may arise due to inconsistent approaches adopted in the identification of business and IT services. Services might not be inter operable, and after the identification of services many of them might be redundant. There might also be a situation where there&#039;s no responsible owner of the identification and delivery of services. Ultimately, all these risks can result in increased project costs and the inability to meet delivery time. Defining the Service Discovery process will help resolve these issues by clearly specifying the involvement needs and responsibilities of different work streams in identifying services.

This paper provides an insight into the participation requirements of different stake holders and their responsibilities in the Service Discovery Process in this Transformation Program and refinement made in the Program Organization Structure based on this insight. This would help the delegates adopting similar programs to understand the program team Structure in a typical SOA based environment, the responsibility of each stake holder and bridge any activity gap required in Service Discovery process. The implementation of governance process for this activity would help to define and streamline the responsibilities of the various stakeholders in this activity.

  <abstract_plain>One of the largest research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in the world has initiated a Transformation Program to address a strategic goal for the Research and Development division to deliver twice the number of new products by 2015. The aim of the program is to rationalize and simplify its clinical information environment by 2014. With such a huge application base, comes the need for large integration requirements and an objective to move from point to point integration to SOA based loosely coupled, reusable and policy governed integration environment. An Integration Factory was setup to facilitate smooth transition to SOA-based integration environment, enforcing governance so that the policies are adhered to and the initiatives are sustained through the adoption of best practices, methodologies and policies leading to reduced cost and risk, better manageability of technology and skills. One of the main objectives of the Integration Factory was to define the governance processes around the service life cycle. In order to realize the expected business benefits of SOA-based integration technologies, it is very important to clearly define the processes around service discovery, development and deployment.

Out of the Service Life Cycle Governance processes, Service Discovery process is of utmost importance as in a big program like this, a variety of project risks may arise due to inconsistent approaches adopted in the identification of business and IT services. Services might not be inter operable, and after the identification of services many of them might be redundant. There might also be a situation where there&#039;s no responsible owner of the identification and delivery of services. Ultimately, all these risks can result in increased project costs and the inability to meet delivery time. Defining the Service Discovery process will help resolve these issues by clearly specifying the involvement needs and responsibilities of different work streams in identifying services.

This paper provides an insight into the participation requirements of different stake holders and their responsibilities in the Service Discovery Process in this Transformation Program and refinement made in the Program Organization Structure based on this insight. This would help the delegates adopting similar programs to understand the program team Structure in a typical SOA based environment, the responsibility of each stake holder and bridge any activity gap required in Service Discovery process. The implementation of governance process for this activity would help to define and streamline the responsibilities of the various stakeholders in this activity.

  <title>Push Notification for Android Apps</title>
  <keywords>Push Notification Android C2DM WebSocket</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Android Development, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>There are many different scenarios, where it can be useful to push data over the communication network to a mobile app. This spans from frequent updates of data to notifications which happens every few weeks. Such notifications can seriously improve the user experience and the usefulness of a mobile app. This session gives a comprehensive overview of push communication for android apps.

1. Overview of the different scenarios, where push communication can be used.

2. Elaboration of the specific constraints which must be addressed by a solution. One example of such a constraint is that frequent communication drains the battery and must therefore be avoided.

3. The fundamental pattern for pushing data to the mobile app.

4. Explanation and comparison of some of the common solutions and frameworks for pushing data to an android app. This includes &quot;Android Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM)&quot;, HTML5 WebSockets, XMPP/BOSH and others. 

Target Audience: Software Engineers and Software Architects

  <title>Learning what works in distributed development</title>
  <keywords>distributed</keywords>
  <topics>11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>Although we have been doing large enterprise Java development projects distributed internationally for almost a decade, like other aspiring international IT companies, we have been interested in how we measure up compared to the state of the art.

In this talk you will learn about the top issues in distributed Java development and with what innovative techniques the larger multinationals face these challenges. We explore, what metrics one can use for measuring, if the techniques are effective. The talk will also acknowledge the problem, that a lot of things that we are already used to measure (like source code quality) will not tell you about other important aspects of a distributed team. For example the communication flow inside the team: this might be best measured with an &#039;email vs instant messaging&#039; ratio.

Finally, we describe how we evaluated our own distributed development against this measuring stack - where we think we have done well (and how we think we know it) and where we think, that we can do better (and how we will be able to judge it).</abstract>

  <keywords>Apache Stanbol, Analyis of unstructured content, semantic technologies</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>Interactive Knowledge Stack (IKS) is a EU founded project to build an open and flexible technology platform for semantically enhanced Content Management Systems (CMS). The main result of the project is Apache Stanbol, its most popular component is the Content Enhancement service. With Content Enhancement natural language text can be enhanced with annotations highlighting the concepts occurring in the text and if wished link them to their respective dbpedia (or wikipedia) entries.

While designed to semantically lift the content of content management systems it turns out to be a very generic tool that can quite easily be integrated in any app dealing with natural language text. As Stanbolis built on OSGi it integrates particulary well with OSGi based applications, howver thanks to its RESTfull endpoint it can easily be accessed in application written in any programming language.

This short presentation will introduce the key concepts and show how to use Stanbol Content Enhancement for your application to have a grasp of what content is about thus allowing more powerful classification and search.</abstract>

  <keywords>JavaScript, Patterns, MVC, REST</keywords>
  <topics>2.2. RIA Frameworks, Java or JavaScript based, 3.1.  Java &amp; JavaScript, 3.4. jQuery, jQuery Mobile, 3.5. JavaScript Frameworks, Tools, Libraries, 3.7. Architectures for JavaScript, 4.7. New UI Paradigms, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Modern browsers allow a great user experience and usability of web applications. More and more user interface logic moves from the server to the browser including managing state and rendering the UI. This comes with the price of increasing complexity on the client side with which web developers have to deal with to not get into problems of maintainability and extensibility.

This talk shows architectural and design concepts to structure an HTML5/JavaScript application to avoid tangling client-side code. Having a well-structured application helps keeping track and control of complex and growing browser applications.

It starts with file organisation of web assets, the importance of having decent build tools for JavaScript applications and bootstrapping an application. The talk then moves to common design patterns used by leading JavaScript frameworks like Backbone.js, Knockout.js and the like. The main concepts of such MVC-look-a-likes of the JavaScript land are covered, explained and illustrated by framework sample code and more lightweight custom code to pinpoint several key features and advantages.

Once having achieved a decent architecture it&#039;s not a big deal anymore to connect a MVC-like application to a REST backend of choice by using common libraries like jQuery. This will be examined based on the concepts formerly introduced and exemplified with jQuery and a JAX-RS (Jersey) backend.

After the talk, the audience has a crisp understanding of the key concepts on how to build well-structured non-trivial HTML5/JavaScript applications by using a common framework or roll an own Model-Controller approach. Code samples will use jQuery as base library. However, concepts and techniques are library neutral and can be applied on arbitrary environments.

  <title>From guru to dummy: Painless switch to Objective C</title>
  <keywords>Objective C, transfer, start</keywords>
  <topics>4.2. iOS Development</topics>
  <abstract>Even though some popular Objective Oriented languages were inspired by Objective C, being the slum dog of the OOL troupe, Objective C was not the preference for a lot of programmers when making the first steps in the OO programming promise land. Omitting the reasons why and how, it’s sufficed to say that Objective C is now indeed becoming an attractive choice for a lot of programmers. So how does a coding guru that has vast knowledge and experience in certain &quot;main-stream&quot; language, leave the comfort of its programming zone for a new and totally unknown developing tool such as Objective C, without feeling like total novice. The endeavor of learning a new programming language is never an easy task, especially when one is accustomed to different set of rules and paradigms. In that case, the most common learning pattern is identifying familiar schemes from previous knowledge and mapping them to the newly discovered resources. Just like learning Chinese, but on English.

The scope and the focus of this presentation will be stating and clearly pointing the known programming paradigms from the most popular OO languages (mostly Java and C#) i.e. English and translating them to Objective C i.e. Chinese.

From protocols, delegates, literals, lambdas, closures to memory management, the presentation will try to provide basic overview about the most known things that an average programmer has encountered in different languages and that can be used and applied with ease in Objective C.

This will not be a crash course in Objective C, but will instead target group of people with basic knowledge of the Objective C syntax, medium to excel knowledge of some other OO language that want to learn more and understand better the semantic of the Objective C so they can easily deploy it in code.</abstract>

  <keywords>BPM, EAM, shared repository</keywords>
  <topics>11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>Three big enterprises from different sectors (government agency, utility company, insurance) with the same goals: to identify internal business processes and to describe the used enterprise architecture artifacts to be able to derive business capabilities, optimize organizational activities and IT-support, reduce costs, motivate employees, enhance flexibility and transparency, and many more.

*But how and where to start?*

In the last years companies have tried different approaches:
- _enterprise wide project_ where the entire enterprise is described to identify company strategy, objectives, all business processes and enterprise and information technology architecture to then start continuous improvements
- _small separated projects_ with different teams in different organizational focusses with process orientation and the commitment of everyone involved to fill the enterprise architecture e.g. via optimization projects, implementing organizational changes, gathering requirements for a new tool, etc.
- _no enterprise-architecture-documentation_ at all based on the fear of producing &quot;mothware&quot;

So what is best practice for benefitting from EAM and BPM in your enterprise with appropriate time and effort? Learn the dos and don´ts for your own enterprise, while listening to this talk.

  <title>Jodd - The Unbearable Lightness of Java</title>
  <keywords>java,framework,tools,jodd</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>Jodd is set of open-source lightweight and fast Java application frameworks. Jodd makes development simple, but not simpler; you get 90% of the features with 10% of usual effort. Frameworks are backed up with nice set of tools that enriches JDK with many powerful and feature rich utilities. And all that under then 1.1 MB!

The purpose of Jodd is to help building small and middle sized applications, without much fuss. If developers are familiar with Java, the learning curve is short, and yet, everything is there. Perfect for basic Java hosting plans, or applications that should be distributed.

What is inside:
- Madvoc: elegant web MVC framework that uses CoC and annotations in a pragmatic way to simplify web application development.
- Petite: slick and lightweight DI container that uses annotations and supports sufficient most of features offered by other containers.
- Proxetta: the fastest proxy creator with unique approach for defying pointcuts and advices.
- DbOom: efficient db mapping tool.
- JTX: manage transactions with this small stand-alone tx manager.
- VTor: focused validation framework for any Java object.
- Lagarto: fast and versatile all purpose HTML parser.
- Decora: decoration framework for pages based on templates.
- Jerry: jQuery-friendly Java parser with CSS selectors support.

And the following tools:
- BeanUtil: the fastest bean library, bundled with type introspection and type conversion tools and some unique features.
- JDateTime: elegant usage and astronomical precision in single time-manipulation class.
- Props: experience super properties replacement, featuring: UTF8, sections, profiles, macros and more.
- Email: sending and receiving emails for busy developers.
- Paramo: access method and constructor parameter names with ease.

etc.

Jodd and it&#039;s parts have been used in many projects up to now.

  <title>Do enterprise-wide software metrics work?</title>
  <keywords>Sonar,Unittest,Metrics,Java,Quality</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>Target Audience: Developers, Software Architects, Project Managers, Quality Managers

Level: Intermediate

Prerequisites: Experience with software development

In a heterogenous environment like a large cooperation with various kinds of different applications, how can enterprise-wide software quality improvement measures be applied? Is there any relevant common ground, can common rules really improve quality? Is there any method that applies to almost any kind of software project?

Projects focus on short term goals and customer requirements. But at SBB software typically has a lifecycle of ten, often even twenty years. This talk will show how SBB Informatik tried and tries to improve (inner) software quality with special focus on maintainability.

For many years, SBB has invested considerably into individually built software with software quality control measures mainly left to the projects themselves. This has led to a very heterogeneous picture of software quality within the different projects and products and to corresponding issues in software maintenance.

In an initiative to improve this situation
- Sonar was introduced as an openly accessible metrics tool
- Several basic policies where introduced (including an new edition of coding guidelines)
- Sonar rules where calibrated to match the guidelines
- SQALE Plugin was introduced and calibrated for a coarse quality measurement and calibrated management view

During the talk, the implications such an automated measurement had at SBB will be discussed. How to get to an agreement on common rules, what is required technically in build technology? What obstacles and issues did we encounter, technically and especially non-technically?

Of course much Software at SBB and elsewhere has been developed earlier with different quality standards in place, so how do we deal with existing code? Do we measure it, do we even improve it?

How to improve beyond simple metrics and rules? In addition to the effort described above, we launched an ongoing effort to introduce Unittesting as a compulsory method for all projects. This is strongly connected to the introduction of Sonar and the measurement of test coverage, as now any lack of coverage is visible, but also the introduction of Scrum in some projects.

So metrics are a major driver to introduce more unit testing in projects. This had strong implications in daily work as we experienced it.

The talk will conclude with an assessment of the current results we achieved and the effort required, compared to the put previously into similar efforts in some of the IT projects at SBB, and the advantages and disadvantages of a global effort.</abstract>

  <abstract>Is SaaS changing the business intelligence strategy?

Business intelligence software as a service aspects considered - A field report

With the increasing replacement of existing software landscapes through software as a service inspired systems (cloud solutions) the question arises of the BI strategy to be elected. Constantly actual existing data, for example in distribution or in support areas, are a strong feature of the architecture. In addition such basic data are not in a directly accessible database, but rather on the &quot;net&quot; of the infrastructure provider (IaaS). For the BI strategy of the future, this means integration into the corresponding SaaS solution; or rather a whole new way to go down? So among other things the direct link between analytical and operational data is a big advantage. However, issues arise in this scenario as a rather debatable point according to the illustration of different point of view on the numbers in a cloud. The session taught BI strategies in a cloud environment can be used and, above all, what are advantages and disadvantages. All this independently of the manufacturer on the basis of diverse practical experience. The opportunity for questions and discussion is part of the presentation.

  <title>SAP Integration, the Java EE Way</title>
  <keywords>Java, SAP, JCA, Hibersap, Cuckoo</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB</topics>
  <abstract>In Java enterprise applications we often need to call functionality in an SAP backend. SAP’s Java Connector (JCo) allows us to remotely call SAP functions, with transactions and good performance. On the other hand, to leverage Java EE specific features like distributed transactions, CMT, and security, we require a resource adapter that implements the Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA). Both of these technologies suffer from the problem that their APIs are far from being state of the art and we need to write a lot of technical glue code, which is tedious and error-prone.

The open source framework Hibersap brings SAP integration to the modern EE world by mapping SAP interfaces to Java business objects using annotations, similar to modern O/R mappers. In combination with the Cuckoo resource adapter, we are now able to implement elegant Java EE applications that integrate SAP backends.

The talk presents both frameworks with a good deal of example code. It is targeted at technical people like Java developers and architects, basic knowledge of the Java programming language and Java EE technologies is recommended. SAP or ABAP knowledge is not needed. The level is &quot;beginner&quot;.</abstract>

  <title>Akka 2.0 - Scaling up and out with Actors</title>
  <keywords>Concurrency Scalability Distributed Actors STM Futures Scala Java</keywords>
  <topics>1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>We believe that one should never have to choose between productivity and scalability, which has been the case with traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution. The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actors together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to create a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka 2.0 this will be taken to a whole new level, and in this presentation we will talk about &quot;Distributed by Design&quot;, how it scales from small projects to huge projects, and how we&#039;ve projected what we&#039;ve learned during the 1.x series into the 2.x series.</abstract>

  <title>Objective-C through Java lenses</title>
  <keywords>java, objectivec, ios</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Android Development, 4.2. iOS Development, 7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>There is no doubt that iOS made Objective-C popular. Naturally, many Java developers would also like to do some iOS stuff. After all, another object oriented language shoud be no problem for experienced Java guy. I was also thinking like this, but very soon I found my self in quite strange and hostile environment.

In this talk I&#039;ll talk about my first steps in Objective-C, some rookie mistakes and ways to work around them.

I am no expert in iOS, so don&#039;t expect rocket science - rather some honest advice from a fellow developer.</abstract>
  <abstract_plain>There is no doubt that iOS made Objective-C popular. Naturally, many Java developers would also like to do some iOS stuff. After all, another object oriented language shoud be no problem for experienced Java guy. I was also thinking like this, but very soon I found my self in quite strange and hostile environment.

  <abstract>The web application landscape is rapidly shifting back to a Client/Server architecture. This time around the Client is JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the browser. The tools and deployment techniques for these types of applications are abundant and fragmented. This session will teach you how to pull together jQuery, LESS, Twitter Bootstrap, and some CoffeeScript to build the Client. The Server could be anything that talks HTTP but this session will use the Play Framework. You will also learn how to deploy Client/Server web apps on the cloud using a Content Delivery Network (Amazon CloudFront) for the Client and a Cloud Application Provider (Heroku) for the Server.</abstract>

  <title>Early Project Cost Estimates based on Assessments</title>
  <keywords>Project Cost Estimation, Cost Drivers, Transfer Function, Soft Skills, Lean Six Sigma</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.3. Supporting innovations without bargaining sustainability</topics>
  <abstract>Software Project Cost Prediction is one of the unresolved problems of mankind. While today’s civil engineering work is more or less under control, software projects are not. Cost overruns are so frequent that it is wise never trusting any initial cost estimate but take precaution for higher cost.

Nevertheless, finance managers need reliable estimates in order to be able to fund software and ICT projects without running risks. Estimates are usually not available before an agile team is created and attacking the problem – thus after the project started. This makes it difficult funding a project before knowing how much funds are needed.

This paper explains how to use the soft factors as cost drivers for taking personal, process, product, and technology aspects into cost estimation. The approach uses Lean Six Sigma tech-niques such as transfer functions for predicting project cost based on early assessments of soft factors that later eventually will impact development and operating cost of software.

  <keywords>Mobile, UI, Interface Design, Touch Interfaces, Basics</keywords>
  <topics>4.7. New UI Paradigms</topics>
  <abstract>As smartphones and tablets are all the rage and broke ground for NUIs (natural user interfaces), common sense is that the touch devices require special attention to interface- and interaction design. The result is - at least in many cases - developers ending up _designing_ user interfaces or, developers _collaborating_ with designers in a new and tighter way. The talk tackles both possible situations for developers: interface-/interaction-design-basics with special consideration of touchable devices will be presented to help developers design better (mobile) interfaces as well as help developers communicate with designers to reduce communicative overhead and, in the end, create beautiful, usable software.

Target Audience: developers, mobile developers, project managers of mobile projects

Level: beginner to intermediate

Prerequisites required of attendees: experiance in mobile development a plus, no special requirements</abstract>

  <title>A Survey of Open Source Cross Platform Cloud APIs</title>
  <keywords>cloud, APIs</keywords>
  <topics>1.4. PaaS/Provisioning, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>According to numerous surveys and studies, among the most cited reasons against the adoption of cloud computing services is the well-founded fear of lock-in. There is likely a large amount of effort needed to move critical business functions to the cloud or integrate cloud services into internal processes. Once this work has been performed, inertia makes it difficult to change yet again if the result is unsatisfactory.

As a direct mitigation of this risk, several commercial and open source products have been launched with the aim of providing universal interfaces for performing common cloud instantiation, deployment, and management operations for a set of providers offering similar services. In some cases, the approach is to select a market leader&#039;s API as a de facto standard and offer emulation of that API for other products (e.g. Eucalyptus for Amazon&#039;s EC2 and S3 APIs, AppScale for Google App Engine&#039;s PaaS API, etc). Another approach involves defining new product-neutral APIs and implementing translation layers to existing services (e.g. apache deltacloud, apache libcloud, and Alcatel/lucent&#039;s jclouds).

In this talk, we survey open source cross platform cloud APIs, describing benefits and caveats for their use in different contexts and suggest evaluation criteria your organization can use for potentially choosing one over the other for a given cloud adoption business case.

  <title>Evaluating IaaS Cloud Providers</title>
  <keywords>cloud, IaaS</keywords>
  <topics>10.1. Cloud Computing for the enterprise</topics>
  <abstract>As with any potentially disruptive business paradigm, the cloud computing market has quickly produced a large choice of cloud providers. In such an environment, it can be difficult to establish objective, measurable and meaningful evaluation criteria with which to choose one provider over another. Adding to this difficulty, there are multiple categories of provider. In Dec 2010, Gartner attempted to meaningfully compare enterprise cloud providers such as Verizon Business with &quot;pure cloud&quot; providers such as Amazon&#039;s AWS in their magic quadrant report. This apples vs oranges was highly controversial.

In this talk, we survey several attempts at evaluations of IaaS cloud providers for enterprise system deployment and report which aspects have resonated such as reaction/recovery from outtages and which have been attacked as pitfalls (neglecting to adequately model the system&#039;s network profile).

This talk limits itself to the evaluation of &quot;pure cloud&quot; infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers, and you will learn which three dozen attributes such as data jurisdiction, process conformance, ease of extraction, etc that are available for comparison among 20 providers and hints on how one can use such results for making choices among providers for the various categories of Enterprise systems (data intensive, compute intensive, etc) for which our customers require reliable, cost-effective infrastructure.

Finally since the cloud services market is constantly changing - new players come onto the scene, and new innovations continually change the landscape - a process is proposed for adapting such evaluation criteria over time.</abstract>

This talk limits itself to the evaluation of &quot;pure cloud&quot; infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers, and you will learn which three dozen attributes such as data jurisdiction, process conformance, ease of extraction, etc that are available for comparison among 20 providers and hints on how one can use such results for making choices among providers for the various categories of Enterprise systems (data intensive, compute intensive, etc) for which our customers require reliable, cost-effective infrastructure.

Finally since the cloud services market is constantly changing - new players come onto the scene, and new innovations continually change the landscape - a process is proposed for adapting such evaluation criteria over time.</abstract_plain>

  <title>Enterprise-wide Cloud Governance Considerations</title>
  <keywords>cloud, governance</keywords>
  <topics>10.1. Cloud Computing for the enterprise</topics>
  <abstract>When considering the adoption of cloud computing services, a business case cannot be complete without a discussion on governance. In particular, it is important to understand that there are likely negative consequences that could result from an ad-hoc, non-deliberately defined governance approach. Even where there are no obvious mis-steps, project-level actions and decisions that might be clearly sensible in isolation might interfere with organization-wide strategic goals if taken in aggregate. Additionally, there might be non-obvious pitfalls - the temptation of immediate implementation after a credit card payment can lead to risks out of proportion to the cost savings incurred by a specific department or team. However, although risk management is vital, it is one of many aspects of governance that should be considered.

Since the general meaning of &quot;governance&quot; simply refers to &quot;the system used for exercising authority&quot;, it has come to represent different ideas to different people. Too often, end users see it in a negative light &quot;governance means rules that make it hard for me to do my job&quot;, and legal departments see it as &quot;rules that we need to prevent exposure to attack&quot;. We propose that if possible it is best to approach governance as &quot;processes that encourage desirable behavior by making common things easy but hard things possible&quot;.

Finally it is important to realize that with all meanings there is no universal &quot;correct&quot; form of governance. Different forms of governance are effective in different situations, for achieving different outcomes, or even for achieving the same outcome in different ways.

  <title>Secure Business Value through Software Engineering</title>
  <keywords>Business Value, Software Engineering, Agile, Process, Model</keywords>
  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>Software Engineering is not just about delivering a sound technical solution. Software Engineering is also about the delivery of business benefit.

What secures business benefit? Besides a sound technical solution, business benefit is secured through active user involvement, excellent business work flow designed through evolutionary prototyping and stakeholder consensus that is derived through facilitated workshops.

Underlying the above mentioned critical success factors is Quality, Ownership and Commitment which in return translate to a quality business solution that is embraced by the users, supported by a well-engineered technical solution creating business value.

The planned presentation will focus on four areas and will be delivered in four steps.

1. How a well software engineered solution or an over engineered solution may still not solve the business challenge?

2. Why is the solution not simply the technical solution?

3. How can one bring software engineering more aligned with good delivery business practices? What will this achieve and why?

4. What should be the first steps that anyone should take to align good delivery business practices with software engineering as to guarantee the applicability of common sense?

Throughout the presentation, the audience will be presented with hard facts that are the result of lack of common sense. The presentation will be interactive with the aim to engage the audience and will predominantly focus on real life examples using case studies.

Software Engineering is not about the technology. Software Engineering is about being a catalyst between men and machine as to create a combustion that delivers business value.</abstract>

  <abstract>Test automation is one of the hottest topics in testing nowadays. The diversity of the test automation tools on offer is mind blowing. In this context, finding an appropriate test automation tool for any application under test is no longer a problem. However, with this diversity of tools comes a high degree of variation in the technologies, interfaces, ways of writing tests and of reporting test results that the test automation engineers have to master.

So how can you shield the test engineers from the complexity of working with numerous different test tools and management from interpreting test results produced with different tools? Come in and find out about a possible solution.</abstract>

  <paper_external_comment>Explanation of the general topic/problem, description of why the delegates should attend the presentation, and highlights of the technologies/concepts the presentation is going to cover: 
When a test automation team delivers services to a wide variety of projects and applications, most often the team has to employ several different test automation tools to cover the requirements of these projects: different testing goals, different underlying technologies, different scopes and time frames. Nowadays finding a test automation tool suitable for every need is no longer a problem, but working with a broad range of test automation tools introduces a high degree of variation in the technologies and interfaces that the test engineers have to master, the content and presentation of the test reports, etc.
At Credit Suisse we have introduced a test framework that can drive all the test automation tools that we use. It thus shields the test engineers from the complexity of working with numerous different test tools and management from interpreting test results produced with different tools. This framework offers a unified interface towards the actual test tools and hence hides the particularities of the tools while ripping their benefits. Perhaps the most important benefit of using such a framework is having a unified approach to test automation across the team and across the different systems being tested. Further benefits are a centralized repository for test administration, increased collaboration in the team and easier knowledge transfers. 
In this talk we present the concept of this framework and its benefits, lessons learned from implementing and using it, and give tips on how similar frameworks can be implemented in different environments.</paper_external_comment>

  <paper_external_comment>This is one of my favorite non-tech talks that I have developed over the years with the goal to help developers succeed as developers (opensource or not).

http://www.slideshare.net/dandreadis/the7secretsofsuccessfulopensourcedevelopers

I&#039;ve given this presentation quite a few times and I can vary the time from 20-30m, if necessary. The uptake is always good and it&#039;s common to have a Q/A session for 10-15m, or as time permits.

So, it could move to a full length 50m session if you want, or it could be part of the main Jazoon tech track, if necessary, since  it&#039;s interesting to developers, in general, although the main elements of success are really common across different professional fields.

Let me know if you need more info!

  <abstract>“Agile” or “Scrum” techniques are becoming more and more popular for developing software. Some developers interpret the part &quot;Working software over comprehensive documentation&quot; of the agile manifesto as a documentation is no longer needed. In my experience, the oposite is true. In an agile environment, a comprehensive documentation and models are even more important and valuable.

In this talk I will elaborate on the area of ​​conflict between agile and comprehensive, substainable documentation and models. I will also present my approach to solve these conflicts. This includes also a set of guidelines for good documentation and models.

  <paper_external_comment>I held presentations at the SEACON 2011 in Hamburg, at the OOP 2012 in München and at the Java User Group Switzerland in Januar 2012. For all my presentations, I received superiour delegate evaluations.
I&#039;m using the &quot;Lessig Method&quot; with images of a common theme, similar to the petcha-kutch style. Each slide holds only one information and will only be shown for a short time. This results in a presentation that is vivid and entertaining.
For this talk, I will use the theme of the film &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;.</paper_external_comment>

  <title>Instant Feedbacker - Stop boring talks</title>
  <keywords>Remote Control, Feedback, GWT, Server Push</keywords>
  <topics>8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>The &#039; instant feedbacker&#039; is a web-application for getting faster user feedback for talks. There&#039;s a client for the audience and a client for the presenter.

The presenter starts a &quot;feedback session&quot; (on his browser-enabled device) and gives this session-id to the audience. The audience can login to this session and give instant-feedback.

The instant-feedback-audience-client looks similar to a remote control so that the user is very used to the interface. Rewind means &#039;please repeat&#039;, forward &#039;jump to the next bullet&#039; and skip is &#039;jump to the next slide&#039;. Stop is &#039;I&#039;m bored and want to go. Stop the talk&#039;. Included in the client is also a small poll application for instant votes during the talk.

The presenter-client shows a weighted feedback over the last 30 seconds for the remote-control part and a resetable chart for the instant vote.

This talk describes the architecture and implementation (GWT, Server Push) and demonstrates the &quot;Instant Feedback Channel&quot;</abstract>

  <title>Standardized Batch Processing on JAP</title>
  <keywords>JEE, SpringBatch</keywords>
  <topics>1.6. PaaS/Practical Experience, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>In Credit Suisse, existing Java batch jobs exhibit a strong dependency on operating specific tools and script languages. These batch jobs required special expertise to develop and are cumbersome to maintain and operate. Consequently, a Batch Working Group was established to define a target architecture based on JEE concepts to move the batch jobs to the Java Application Platform (JAP) and thus to leverage the existing platform where possible. Various Java batch frameworks were evaluated that resulted in choosing SpringBatch. SpringBatch is an open source, lightweight and comprehensive framework for batch processing. JAP AR 7 will be the first JAP release that enables the development of batch jobs as integrated into the JAP Application Platform using the SpringBatch framework.

The Application Platform factors out, automates, and optimizes infrastructure common for specific types of applications. Furthermore it standardizes the technology stack enabling high-quality engineering and testing of components, automates key activities and processing based on efficient configuration, development, and operations. Application developers benefit from streamlined development being supported by a rich set of guidelines. The business benefits from cost-effective operations and shortened time to market. The Java Application Platform (JAP) targets JEE multi-tier architectures based on SOA principles. The extension JAP Batch offers a standardized JEE based infrastructure, guidelines, and processes for batch processing.

The batch target architecture structures a batch job in different phases:

− The Transfer phase, either at the beginning (receive) or the end (send) of a batch application, enables the integration of different applications over files.

− The Import phase provides the means to efficiently read and import the data files to the application’s own database.

− The Processing phase executes the actual business logic reading from and writing to the application’s database, invoking synchronous or asynchronous services where applicable.

− The Output phase finally extracts data from the applications’ own database to a file further usage by, e.g., successive batch applications.

Business logic processing is executed entirely in the Application Server. The batch component exclusively accesses data in the application owned database and is integrated into the middleware infrastructure to leverage synchronous and asynchronous service communication. The business logic implementation is in the responsibility of the application and thus guarantees the reuse of the respective logic also for the online part of the application.

For data import/export a landing zone to temporarily hold data files for further processing is provided. (UNIX) Scripts are used to send and receive files with ftps, and archive processed files for disaster recovery. For the data import into the database, existing DB tools are used. The underlying batch model enables the generation of such standard scripts providing standardized solutions for the common use cases. To schedule and orchestrate batch jobs, the enterprise scheduler Control-M is used.

The first part of the talk introduces the concept and the target architecture for the new JAP Batch Components. The second part of the talk presents the technical architecture and integration of the SpringBatch framework into the JAP Application Server. Furthermore, we discuss the design of the first pilot application and report on the experiences and results of this first successful JAP Batch Component.

  <title>Make Text Search “Work” for your Apps</title>
  <keywords>Search Enterprise Relevance SOLR Lucene</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Over the last few years, powerful text search has emerged as a de facto requirement for all applications. This includes traditional enterprise applications which earlier used to provide limited text matching. While the traditional applications have been re-architected to make use of text search libraries and frameworks, the newer SaaS applications have been built with contemporary text search being a requirement from the outset.

However, users of such applications often complain that searches are quite slow as compared to the Web search engines or popular online stores. They do not perceive search results to be of the same quality either. Sometimes users even claim that they are unable to find items that actually do exist. This seems ironical, given that text search libraries and frameworks like Lucene, SOLR, Katta, Elastic Search, Hibernate Search etc. are known to do wonders for some of the most heavily used internet sites. So there must be things that could have been done better. This session aims to address those areas.

This presentation will make use of real-life examples to illustrate the key concepts that are essential for building fast and accurate searches for regular transactional applications. It will appeal to those planning to build text search capabilities into their applications, as well as those grappling with problematic search implementations. Attendees will obtain key insights into the following areas:
- What actually tends to go wrong and how
- Pragmatic strategies to achieve the right marriage between the database world of rich structured relationships and the fast world of flat text documents
- Common pitfalls to avoid as a designer and developer including requirements that do not go well with the way text search works
- Considerations involved in choosing the right tool/framework in different scenarios
- Important operational issues to be addressed like re-creating the index without affecting the availability
- Testing approaches to ensure that users never lose faith in the quality of search results

  <title>Clean Sweep the File System</title>
  <keywords>File-System Scale NIO-2 API Performance</keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE</topics>
  <abstract>File I/O has been around since JDK 1.0, but lacked many capabilities. It has been majorly overhauled in NIO-2 as a part of the JDK 7 release. This has a groundbreaking impact on the way Java applications interact with the file system. The new API brings a fresh perspective for accessing and manipulating the file system.

This session will help developers to quickly grasp the changes introduced in NIO-2. Developers will appreciate the relevance of NIO-2 and would be able write high performance and scalable components using the new API. This talk will cover the below areas where the Java file system API has been enhanced, along with real world examples of the usage:
- How file systems defy platform independence.
- How to make file system operations atomic.
- How can an application magically detect changes in the file, or in the file-system.
- What could go wrong if an application accepts files without probing on their content? And what are the checks an application must perform, before accepting files.
- How can the symbolic links be resolved, and traversed.
- Walking over the file tree.
- Transitioning from the file API to the new(er) file API, and much more.</abstract>

  <title>Data Security Essentials for Cloud Computing</title>
  <keywords>Security Cloud Data Cryptography Performance</keywords>
  <topics>1.5. PaaS/Security, 7.2. Security</topics>
  <abstract>Data is central to Cloud Computing, and data security remains the biggest concern of customers who want to leverage the power of cloud computing. Companies need to act responsibly in managing their data all through its life-cycle. Given the increased emphasis on data security and the regulations around the same, application designers need to pay extra attention to this area. Any unintentional compromise of sensitive data could sap customer confidence and generate unwanted negative publicity.

Data needs to be handled securely at all the stages by cloud service providers, from transmission, to computation, to persistence. This talk will bootstrap developers with the basics of applied cryptography, choice of relevant algorithms, and the various secure data transport and storage options. Trade offs between the cryptographic strength, performance, and storage size will be illustrated. It will also cover the application of specialized hardware cryptographic processors for scenarios involving the most stringent data security.

The audience will be able to quickly digest the Java APIs for data security, and think in terms of handling data securely at all stages of data flow through the application. The session will also present the new security enhancements in JDK 7, and the audience will be exposed to some of the popular open source libraries that can be used to achieve data security.

  <abstract>For the past few years and currently there is much hype around simplifying and reducing the noise in the code. Whether it’s DSL’s, closures (Project Lambda), aspects, CDI, or annotations, fundamental changes have and are occurring that are loosely classified as syntactic sugar. This presentation takes a step back by having an open and honest discussion from two different perspectives from an advocate for the syntactic sugar and a pragmatic engineer that sees some of it as syntactic salt. Whether you see these elements as sugar or salt, you can take a step back and assess whether these elements really simplify the code or make the code more complex. </abstract>

  <title>Java Concurrent Animated</title>
  <keywords>Concurrency, design patterns, visualization, animation</keywords>
  <topics>7.1. Java Language, JDK, JRE, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>This presentation consists of a series of animations that visualize the functionality of the components in the java.util.concurrent library.

 Each animation features buttons that correspond to the method calls in that component. Each click of a button shows how the threads interact in real time. The animations are controlled by the actual Java concurrent component they are illustrating, so the animation is not only a visual demonstration, it&#039;s also a code sample. 

Key points covered will be

 - An explanation of the use case for each of 14 concurrent components. - Description of the design pattern handled by the component - How the concurrent component handles the use case
- Visualization through animation of the use case.

Components covered include - Executors (non-fair &amp; fair)
- Runnable/Callable
- Semaphore
- Future - Reentrant Lock - ReadWriteLock - Condition - BlockingQueue - CyclicBarrier - CountDownLatch - CompletionService - ConcurrentHashMap - Fork &amp; join - Compare &amp; Swap

 If you’re still using constructs like Thread.start or wait/notify, you&#039;ll want to attend this meeting. 

The presentation is packaged as a self-executable Java Archive (JAR) file and is available for download. It&#039;ll serve as a valuable reference for any Java practitioner.</abstract>

  <title>Testing Java Persistence Done Right with Arquillia</title>
  <keywords>java, testing, automation</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>The Persistence Layer is one of the most crucial parts of enterprise applications, and we use many different frameworks and patterns to keep it clean. We write sophisticated queries and use optimization techniques to give our end users the greatest possible experience.

So why is Persistence very often skipped in testing efforts? Is it really that complex and painful to setup? The Arquillian Persistence Extension removes that burden and boilerplate to make you a happy and productive programmer again! Join this session and see for yourself that writing tests for your database logic is as easy as writing normal unit tests! Don&#039;t expect too many slides, be prepared for live demos!</abstract>

  <title>Acceptance Test Driven Development with Arquillian</title>
  <keywords>java, testing, automation, bdd</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.7. Behavior Driven Development, Specification By Example</topics>
  <abstract>It’s great to have a solid base of unit and integration tests; this gives us confidence about overall system integrity. But at the end of the day it all amounts to whether our end users are happy using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?

During this talk we will see that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more than just integration testing. We will dive into the concept of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and demonstrate how to build higher-level, end-to-end functional tests; we willl be emulating user interactions using the Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automation tool WebDriver. Reusable web testing components called Page Objects will make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar coat them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testing nirvana.

If you care about quality of your software you definitely shouldn&#039;t miss this talk! Expect to see lots of live demos!</abstract>

  <abstract>We all know that unit tests are great, but relying on them alone is often just an illusion of safety. At the end of the day it all amounts to whether our users are happy or frustrated.

Along this journey we will learn how use open source browser automation tool WebDriver together with easyb, a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to have fun from writing functional tests. But that’s just the beginning. As a next step we will see how to build CI infrastructure based on virtual machines to make our tests repeatable. Is it everything what we can do? Definitely not! To conclude the talk we’ll learn how to make functional tests a foundation for automated screencasts. This can be later used to analyze behavior which led to failure, but what is even more interesting we can provide these vidoes to end users as an application manual.</abstract>

  <title>Technical Debt</title>
  <keywords>Code debt, Slow development, History, Missed deadlines, Embarrassing code</keywords>
  <topics>6.4. Collaboration Tools, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>What is it? How can we get rid of it?

Technical debt is the cost of putting off good development practices. When you borrow money you end up having a debt. Loans must be repaid. When you cut corners in your development, you end up with a technical debt. Technical debts also need to be repaid.

Avoiding amortizing your technical debt and instead increasing it will result in a code base that rots. A code base that rots is a bad code base and it will slow down development until it finally grinds to a halt. Building up a technical debt isn’t something that happens over a night. It is the sum of all shortcuts made during development.

How can we remove technical debt?

The first thing that needs to be done is to recognize that we have a problem. We will never solve a problem that we don’t know of. Realizing that we have technical debt is something your manager won’t do; he doesn’t look at the code base. Your manager may be aware of the declining development pace and wonder why everything takes longer and longer time. Your job as somebody that works with the code is to use a proper language that a manager can understand to describe the problems. Finding the technical debt is something you as a developer has to do. When it is identified, you can start to amortize it. Amortizing your technical debt means refactoring your bad code to clean code.

I will introduce the concept of technical debt and give you examples that you can use when talking to non technical people about the problems in your codebase.</abstract>

  <topics>7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>What happens if you write something quick and dirty? What happens if you cut corners? You will most likely end up with a code base that is hard to read and hard to maintain. This is the definition of bad code and technical debt.

Is this a problem? Is bad code really an issue that you want to consider? Yes, if you plan to maintain and extend it to adapt to new or changing business requirements. Bad code is rotting code that gradually will slow you down until you grind to a halt. Can this be avoided? Yes, if you always strive for god testability and maintainability and thus end up with a clean code base.

I will discuss the concept of Clean Code in this presentation and introduce the concepts laid out in the books Clean Code by Robert C Martin, Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers and Refactoring by Martin Fowler.

Topics that will be covered are

* Meaningful Names – why is naming so important?

* Functions – how should they be written and which abstraction level should they contain?

* Comments – why do you write comments?

* Objects and Data Structures – which abstractions should we have?

* Error Handling – checked or unchecked exceptions?

* Unit Tests – how should they be written and what should they communicate?

* Successive Refinement – how do we evolve our implementation?

Be prepared for a lot of code examples, some of them really bad, and suggestions on how to make them more readable. Readable but bad code can be fixed. Converting bad code to readable code is a good start, but it is not the end.

Be prepared for a lot of code examples, some of them really bad, and suggestions on how to make them more readable. Readable but bad code can be fixed. Converting bad code to readable code is a good start, but it is not the end.</abstract_plain>

  <title>bbvfsm - A Finite State Machine Library in Java</title>
  <keywords>FSM, Java, Library, State, Machine</keywords>
  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 7.5. Domain-Specific Languages, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc), 7.8. Effective framework and library documentation, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Every non-trivial application is composed of states and its functionality can be treated as a transition from one state into another. Viewed in this light every application is a state machine. Often the definition of states and transitions is implicit. Although in some applications area it is reasonable to make these definitions explicit.

Kinds of such applications are the implementation of communication protocols or graphical user interfaces with mutual dependencies. Whenever those applications are complex, multi-threaded, asynchronous or contain varying versions, classic approaches with switch-case statements or using the State pattern will push to its boundaries.

During a project we had to implement a set of complex communication protocols in a mission critical application. The server application has to communicate with hundreds of thousands of embedded devices running on different firmware versions. It figured out, that a powerful state-machine library is inevitable. We could not find an appropriate library in Java. Therefore we decided to port and enhance the bbv finite state-machine library originally written for the .NET platform. The bbvfsm Java port is published under Apache 2.0 license on Google Code as well as on the public maven repository. Both versions of the library are deployed successfully in multiple business critical applications.

The library provides a fluent interface which is implemented as an internal DSL to define state-machines. The functionality is comprehensive and based on the Harel State Charts. The big advantage of such a definition is that the bigger part of the definition is validated statically by the compiler. Furthermore, such a definition enables the dedicated testing of state-machine.

The state-machine is enumerator based, hierarchical and allows the definition of actions on transitions as well as on entry and on exit of particular states. Besides of that it provides comprehensive logging mechanism. The definition of the state-machine can be documented in graphical and tabular manner automatically.

Our presentation will give a short introduction on state-machines and shows the utilization and features of bbvfsm on behalf of examples. We will conclude the talk with an experience report about the implementation of complex communication protocols in the field of industry using our library.

  <title>Executable Specifications</title>
  <keywords>Automated testing, Executable Specifications, Specifications by Example, Behaviour driven development, Cucumber</keywords>
  <topics>6.4. Collaboration Tools, 6.7. Behavior Driven Development, Specification By Example</topics>
  <abstract>Elisabeth Hendricksson stated at Turku Agile Day 2010 that “Specs is an abbreviation for speculations”. She is right, specs are often speculations. How can this be avoided?

Execution of code doesn&#039;t leave any room for speculations. If the specs can be executed, they aren&#039;t speculations anymore.

Specifications can be expressed in many different ways. One popular form is as Word documents. Word documents are hard to execute, they need to be interpreted and the writers intent may be lost in the translation.

It would be nice to remove the risk of misinterpretation and the risk of losing the authors intent during the translation. This can only be done if no interpretation takes place and no translation is done. The solution is obviously to create specifications that can be executed.

If we want to execute a specification, do we not have to write a program to do so? If the customers could write the program, then they wouldn&#039;t need us do it for them and the initial problem would not even exist. The answer is no, they don’t have to write a program. They only need to express themselves so the expression can be used in an execution later.

I will show you a way to express what your want, in a formal way, so that it can be used as the basis for an execution. The customer only need to be able to express what they want in a few sentences in their natural language of choice. This description will be translated into something that is actually executable.

Given a system setup in a particular way

When something is executed

Then the result is expected to be a new state of the system

This formal way of expressing yourself can be translated and used as the basis for an execution of the system under test.

This presentation will give you more details about the why, an example of how (executed live of course) and finally some potential drawbacks.

You may not know all details after this session, but you will know that it can be done and how it can be done.

  <title>Automate Testing of Web Services</title>
  <keywords>Testing web services, SoapUI, Maven, Automated testing, Cucumber</keywords>
  <topics>5.2. Integration, WebServices, SOA, ESB, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 6.7. Behavior Driven Development, Specification By Example</topics>
  <abstract>Testing the software your write is crucial. It is so important that you shouldn’t leave it to be done manually. How do you test a web service that you just created? You can of course write a client, connect it and verify that a message is passed through properly. This is definitely a good way. The problem is to test a client that communicates with a service that you don’t own, can’t access in your development environment or that you only provide.

A great open source tool for testing web services is SoapUI. It will allow you to test a service you just created by sending a request to it. It will allow you to specify a service and act as a mock for that service. All you need is the WSDL that defines a SOAP based web service and you will be able to use SoapUI as client or as a mock.

It is possible to integrate a SoapUI test script with Maven so that you can prepare your tests with the graphical SoapUI tool and run them every time you build your project. As an additional step, I will show how Cucumber-jvm can be used to define our test cases so a non programmer can read and validate the test case that actually will be executed.

I will demonstrate how we can set up a test environment to test both a web service provided by us, as well as connecting to a service provided by somebody else, and test them during our Maven build.

  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 6.6. Build Management, 6.7. Behavior Driven Development, Specification By Example</topics>
  <abstract>Verifying that a system works is one of the most important tasks for a project. It is, however, difficult for humans to do testing repeatedly. Humans get sloppy after a while and start to miss out on important things. The way to go is to use humans for exploratory testing and automate testing of all important flows in the system.

I will show the participants how to test web applications using JUnit and Selenium. There will be code, a test run and a green bar.

Selenium is an open source tool that will test a web site through a browser. It is therefore perfect for testing web sites that need to support a combination of different browsers on different operating systems.

The tests are normal JUnit tests that will drive a browser and fail if the test fails and pass if the test passes. Reading JUnit tests are sometimes difficult so as an additional step, I will show how Cucumber-jvm can be used to define our test cases so a non programmer can read and validate the test case that actually will be executed.

The web application will be deployed on a server using Maven and the entire integration test will be performed with one command to Maven. This includes downloading the application server and all tools needed and finally running all tests. In short, a one click build.

Learning outcomes

* The participants will know that automation of testing web applications is possible

* The participants will have seen that the entire build process is possible to automate using Maven

  <topics>5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Software development is an industry that has been around for a little bit more than 50 years. There are a lot of really smart people working in this industry. How is it possible that these smart people are so good at failing? How can we as an industry continue year after year with failing or really slow development?

The answer is embarrassingly easy, we tend to apply methods and techniques we don&#039;t understand or that don&#039;t bring any value.

There are many anti patterns that can be applied to software projects. They tend to fall into these categories:

* Architectural

* Development

* User interface

* Organisational

* Management

We will look at a selection of these anti patterns and see why they are so bad and the problems they contribute with.

Just looking at bad examples may be depressing. But if you can identify a bad example in your own project or product then you have a chance to do something about it. Understanding and accepting that you have a problem is always the first step to fix it.

Keywords: JavaScript, GWT, UJS, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript

Abstract
- -------

JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web. It gains ever growing importance in

programming web-applications due to dynamic content presentation and user

expectations. JavaScript is the default query language for many web content

oriented NoSQL datastores, such as CouchDB, Membase, Riak and MongoDB. It has

further gained additional attention due to server side implementations such as

_node.js_. It is now next to impossible to ignore JavaScript for the majority

of developers and businesses involved with IT.

JavaScript is also the language which has many properties that can hardly not

be labeled as defects or deficiencies. This talk is aimed at dealing with

JavaScript&#039;s shortcomings and how to leverage the parts of JavaScript that are

highly productive.

The talk begins with an introduction to JavaScript&#039;s idiosyncratics by a few

typical and illustrative examples. We discover the reasons for these by taking

a look a JavaScript&#039;s history. Many libraries and frameworks are available for

JavaScripts. There are a few lessons to be learned from how they are organized

and how they use JavaScript. However, they help little in writing good

JavaScript code itself. Language wrappers try to solve this problem. We take a

look at failed, successful, and promising approaches. We wrap-up with some

lessons on how to write effective JavaScript today.

This is also a personal story of how the author learned over many years that

JavaScript isn&#039;t just an unfit or &quot;toy&quot;[^TY] programming language but an

adequate tool if taken seriously and dealt with properly. The author

programmed JavaScript for the browser for many years. More recent work

includes programming JavaScript queries for datastores, like CouchDB and Riak,

and in particular server side JavaScript for the event-loop based _node.js_

platform.

The talk is aimed for a general audience including developers, software

architects and those making decisions. There will be some technical

consideration, as well as a few lines of code to underline practical

application and manifest theoretical concepts. We focus on solutions that can

be applied immediately or in the near future. Technologies that might become

applicable and important in the far future (such as Dart) are out of the scope.

Detailed Contents and Outline
- ----------------------------

Note to whom it might concern: treat the following as supplementary and

additional information to the abstract given above. It should give a more

precise idea of how this talk will be organized, and how it contrasts to other

submissions.

### Introduction Defects and Deficiencies of JavaScript

We will rather quickly browse though some of the superficial problems of

JavaScript, such as:

* global variable abatement,

* type coercion,

* the restrictions given by the single numeric type,

* overloading of equality operators, and

* the semantics of _this_.

### The History of JavaScript

The history of JavaScript is a very entertaining story. The past of JavaScript

is also quite important to understand its defects and to find means to mitigate

them.

We cover the birth of JavaScript with the story of Brendan Eich who aimed to

deliver an effective scripting environment based on the Scheme[^SC] programing

language. The course of events took a different direction and JavaScript ended

up as a very quickly hacked out hybrid of Scheme and Self[^SLF] with a Syntax

resembling closely the C-languages (C, and later Java as well as C#).

JavaScript quickly gained a dubious reputation in its early years of existence.

The reasons were not so much based on JavaScript&#039;s real problems. They were

rather due to annoying usage of JavaScript for web-pages (of the late 90s and

first years of the new millennium), browser security problems, and developers

(including the author) that were fooled by JavaScript&#039;s appearance that it

should behave like C, Java, or C# (which couldn&#039;t be much further from the

truth).

### Libraries and Frameworks

We will very briefly discuss libraries like Prototype, YUI, and finally jQuery.

We mention a few unique properties of jQuery which boosted its success. We

discuss how we can transfer the patterns to apply JavaScript effectively for

our own needs. We will in particular consider how jQuery&#039;s design is

influenced (deliberately or not) by fundamental patterns of functional

programming. The same is true for Linq in dot-NET. We therefore argue that

these patterns do have importance even in strongly object oriented, or at least

multi paradigm programming.

### Language Wrappers: GWT, CoffeeScript, and ClojureScript

#### GWT

Wrappers have been introduced for various kinds of reason and with vastly

different approaches. We briefly discuss the GWT, since it applies to Java

developers and also since it gained mentionable success.

#### Ruby on Rails UJS

Ruby on Rails had and still has what is called the _Unobtrusive Java Script

API_, which is generally known as UJS. It abstracts away the JavaScript

language completely and is therefore superficially similar to the GWT approach.

It has been of limited success due to its limited power and tendency to

obfuscate. It seems that the rails people have come to their senses with the

well known motto:

&gt; If you want JavaScript code in your application, learn JavaScript and write it!

Newer versions of the Rails framework embrace JavaScript by bundling in jQuery

and by offering to write CoffeScript. Both have become defaults for the

framework.

#### CoffeeScript - It&#039;s just JavaScript

CoffeeScript is a very lightweight wrapper that doesn&#039;t aim to replace

JavaScript and its fundamental design as such. Instead, it provides plenty

syntactic sugar and incentives that lead to more expression oriented instead of

imperative programing style. We can avoid many of JavaScript&#039;s pitfalls by

using CoffeeScript. E.g. those concerning equality, object existence and the

creation objects. CoffeeScript is vastly more readable than raw JavaScript and

hence provides benefits in particular with maintaining a project over a

substantial duration.

This section will include a few examples that underline the benefits for

practical matters. The author is using CoffeeScript for about 2 1/2 years by

now.

&gt; I don&#039;t have the shadow of a doubt that CoffeeScript is (at this

time) the best way to write effective[^EFF] and maintainable JavaScript.

CoffeeScript doesn&#039;t replace JavaScript and still requires knowledge of

JavaScript itself to write effective code. The overhead is still well worth

it. Only a few hours of CoffeeScript training will lead to improved JavaScript

code. This is in particular true in a collaborative environment (a lesson

learned from the author&#039;s current project involvement).

#### ClojureScript

ClojureScript is an extension to the Clojure language that translates code

written in Clojure into JavaScript. Clojure itself is a Lisp[^CLJ] for the Java

Virtual Machine. It is the second language after Scala that has attracted

enough support such that it can be expected to sustain.

ClojureScript is placed with a few notable respects between CoffeeScript and

GWT. It provides one unique language for writing code on the JVM-based sever

part and the JavaScript client. At the same time, it doesn&#039;t force us into

writing objection oriented code.

The author would argue that ClojureScript is probably too new to be used for

many projects. There are a few success stories but also reports of corner cases

that were not trivial to overcome. However, due to the properties listed

above, ClojureScript might be worth a consideration in the near or very near

future.

Conclusion
- ---------

JavaScript is an important language that can&#039;t be ignored. It has several rough

corners and defects. The art in effectively employing JavaScript lies in the

art of avoiding certain patterns and problems. Libraries and wrappers amend our

efforts to write effective and maintainable JavaScript Code. However, none of

the efforts has been able to replace a deeper understanding of JavaScript

itself. Further, programming in JavaScript should not be underestimated.

JavaScript is a multi paradigm language and delivering non trivial[^TRV]

libraries or programs deserves at least the same attention as would be given to

Java or C#.

Footnotes
- ---------

[^SC]: Scheme is a Lisp-1 dialect, essentially a non pure functional programing

language. It is pronouncedly different from the common fashion of programing

in the mid 90s.

[^TY]: Actually, there is no such thing as a &quot;toy&quot; programming language.

[^SLF]: Self is a rather object oriented language with prototypal inheritance. A

maybe more modern and better known language of the same category would be IO.

[^EFF]: Effective in the same meaning as in Joshua Bloch&#039;s book &quot;Effective Java&quot;.

Contrast this with what is referred as BlackBelt- or Ninja-JavaScript, which

sacrifices maintainability over (often questionable) performance benefits.

[^CLJ]: Clojure is, like Scheme, a Lisp-1 dialect. It differs more from Common

Lisp than many other Lisp descendants. It is aimed more on providing

maintainable code as compared to extreme expressiveness.

[^TRV]: Contrast this with lightweight JavaScript usage (of say jQuery) to achieve

lightweight html/css user interface effectes.

  <bibliography>About the Author
================

Dr. Thomas Schank is a Senior Software Engineer at the IT-Center of the ZHdK
(Zürcher Hochschule der Künste) in Zürich Switzerland. He builds internal and
public web applications using modern environments using (j)Ruby on Rails and
JavaScript. The author&#039;s focus is on data-architecture, web-architecture, and
scalability. He also contributes to the project by actually writing code almost
every day. 

Thomas received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Karlsruhe.
The main area of his expertise is in efficient algorithms for data- and
network-analysis and their implementation in Java and C++.

The author started out with programming as a hobby. He spent several years
using C/C++, Java, and C# professionally. Nowadays, he is more inclined towards
the functional programming styles and to languages that provide convenient
abstractions to employ those. He was involved with the conventional enterprise
(JEE, .NET) stack in the past. Web programing (starting from CGI, PERL, and of
course JavaScript) has been part of his work from the mid 90s.  He argues that
web programming has become very exciting and challenging in the past years. 


The author has given numerous talks at international conferences and workshops.
The two most recent events have been:

*  Jazoon&#039;11 the International Conference on the Modern Art of Software, the
   slides of the talk &quot;NoSQL - Schemaless Data-stores Not Only for the Cloud&quot;
   can be obtained from
   [here](http://drtom.schank.ch/talks/2011/06/NoSQL-Jazoon2011-Schank.pdf).

  <abstract>So you are sold on the write once run anywhere promise of the HTML5/JavaScript combo? Rather sooner than later you will want to look into your options for off-line applications and off-line persistence then, provided by today&#039;s HTML5 browsers on both mobile devices and on the desktop. Besides &quot;local storage&quot;, which is targeted at smaller, unstructured key/value pair data, you can choose between WebSQL or IndexedDB for your larger, structured data.

While the latter is the way to go, if you bet on standards, the former is still a valid alternative. Although WebSQL is marked deprecated as a W3C standard, an SQLite based, matured implementation is available in the stock (default) browsers on Google&#039;s and Apple&#039;s mobile devices - and it&#039;s familiar SQL.

We&#039;ll look at the current implementation status of both approaches and show how persistence problems are solved by walking through an offline example application.

For tasks, Mylyn already streamlines workflow by providing first-class integration with the IDE. The recent Mylyn project restructuring now enables the same integrated workflows for code reviews, builds and version control systems like Git. For example, a developer can use the Mylyn Task List to track a requirement. On task activation, the EGit Mylyn integration automatically branches managing the change in the workspace. Once a commit is pushed Gerrit stages the change, creates a code review and a Hudson build is triggered to execute tests. Meanwhile, the Mylyn Reviews project enables a team member to complete a code review and provide feedback to the developer, all without leaving the IDE.

  <abstract>In order to bring the productivity benefits of the task-focused interface to engineers using Eclipse-based modeling technologies, Mylyn created a “Context Bridge” for EMF-based models and diagram editors. The result of this will be a focused mode for diagrams that shows only the elements related to the task-at-hand, dramatically reducing information overload for engineers working on large models. In addition, the task-focused interface extensions will provide Mylyn’s one-click multitasking facilities for working with models, ensuring that engineers can instantly recover from interruptions, and share model-specific expertise, when working with models in addition to what Mylyn already provides for engineers working with source code. In this session, we will showcase the use of the task-focused interface within the Ecore Tools and the Papyrus UML Editor. In addition, we will discuss the aspects of bringing the task-focused interface to model and diagram editors and will give a quick overview how to enable these for your own diagram types.</abstract>

In addition, the task-focused interface extensions will provide Mylyn’s one-click multitasking facilities for working with models, ensuring that engineers can instantly recover from interruptions, and share model-specific expertise, when working with models in addition to what Mylyn already provides for engineers working with source code. In this session, we will showcase the use of the task-focused interface within the Ecore Tools and the Papyrus UML Editor. In addition, we will discuss the aspects of bringing the task-focused interface to model and diagram editors and will give a quick overview how to enable these for your own diagram types.</abstract_plain>

  <title>Eclipse Mylyn: Connecting Agile, ALM and the IDE</title>
  <keywords>alm agile mylyn tasktop eclipse ide hp alm rtc rally tfs rtc bugzilla jira visual studio qc</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 6.5. Version Control, 6.6. Build Management, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>In under four years, Mylyn’s task-focused interface has gone from a university whiteboard to a tool with over a million monthly downloads. Not long ago, the notion of a tool that re-aligns the IDE around Agile collaboration and hides more of the program than it shows seemed radical. But as the task-focused interface continues its adoption, the next big step in the evolution of developer tools is becoming clear. In order to get the full benefits of Agile, the planning loop must be connected to development activities across the application lifecycle. This talk will showcase Mylyn and the broad ecosystem which encompasses over 50 different integrations for ALM systems. We will demonstrate how tasks, source code and builds can be managed effectively with Mylyn, and examine how re-aligning collaboration around a unified notion of tasks not only accelerates developer’s adoption of Agile project management tools, but also yields a measurable productivity benefit when deployed in teams.</abstract>

  <title>Why you should care about software assessment</title>
  <keywords>software assessment, software analysis, quality assurance</keywords>
  <topics>10.3. Architecture reviews and criterias for doing so, 10.4. Dealing with technical debts in the enterprise (e.g. addressing it in a distributed setting), 11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>What is assessment? The process of understanding a given situation to support decision making. During software development, engineers spend as much as 50% of the overall effort on doing precisely that: they try to understand the current status of the system to know what to do next. In other words, assessing the current system accounts for half of the development budget. These are just the direct costs. The indirect costs can be seen in the quality of the decisions made as a result. That is why you should care about it.

What can you do about it?
- Make it explicit. Ignoring it won&#039;t make it go away. By acknowledging its existence you have a chance of learning from past experiences and of optimizing your approach.
- Tailor it. Currently, developers try to assess the system by reading the source code. This is highly ineffective and it simply does not scale to the size of the modern systems. You need tools, but not any tools. Your system is special and your most important problems will be special as well. That is why generic tools that produce nice looking reports won&#039;t make a difference. You need smart tools that are tailored to your needs.
- Educate it. The ability to assess is a skill. Like any skill, it needs to be educated. Enterprises need to understand that they need to allocate the budget for those custom tools, and engineers need to understand that it is within their reach to build them. It&#039;s not rocket science. It just requires a different focus.

All in all, assessment is a discipline and it should be treated like one. More information about our view on assessment can be found at:

http://humane-assessment.com

The talk is targeted equally to software engineers and managers, and it exemplifies the above points through several case studies.</abstract>

  <title>ALM integration with OSLC and Eclipse Lyo</title>
  <keywords>oslc, eclipse, lyo, rest, semantic web, alm, integration, ide, tools</keywords>
  <topics>2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.4. Collaboration Tools, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>Eclipse has an history as an integration platform for development tools, long before it became the universal platform it is today.

But being based on a &quot;common framework&quot; integration metaphor, there&#039;s still the unanswered challenge on how to integrate external repositories, legacy tools and multi-vendor solutions into a seamless, lean, end-to-end development environment for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solutions.

The OSLC project (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration, http://open-services.net) aims at providing a solution for this, by leveraging the principles of a RESTful integration architecture and semantic web ontologies. It is already supported by popular open-source projects (like Mylyin, Mantis...) and commercial software vendors as the &quot;glue&quot; for realizing ALM tool solutions.

The Eclipse Lyo project (http://eclipse.org/lyo) provides a set of test suites and reference implementations for OSLC specifications, that can be used as a base for your own integration implementations

This session gives an overview of the architecture and principles of OSLC and Eclipse Lyo, and the speaker will talk about some experience from actual customer projects (e.g. a case study for a german automotive vendor).

Participants will get an idea how to leverage this approach for their own integration architecture projects.

  <title>Monitoring Techniques for SAAS Applications</title>
  <keywords>Monitoring techniques, Monitoring tools, Software as a Service (SAAS), Infrastructure, Availability and User Experience</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>This paper addresses the problem of monitoring Software as a Service (SAAS) Applications to ensure application availability, improve user experience and minimize operations and maintenance work. SAAS applications directly serve a wide range of human and software clients located all over the world, hence the availability, functionality and response time is of very high importance and of very high impact. Our intent with this paper is to highlight the importance of monitoring in a distributed SAAS application and offer the audience a starting point in defining their monitoring needs. The monitoring techniques and solution we present can address SAAS applications, Web application, on-site deployments and development environments and infrastructures. Our experience shows that the number of operations (or DevOps) engineers required for maintenance of a SAAS application greatly diminishes with the use of monitoring tools and aggregation of the data they provide. Clearly, better monitoring leads to faster response time to any Customer-facing issue that the application is experiencing. We address five dimensions of SAAS applications that require monitoring: functionality, components and layers, internal infrastructure, availability and performance.

The paper is for intermediate level and the audience is from the technical side of Software Engineering: from Architects and Developers who implement and expose monitoring endpoints, to QA Engineers that ensure the monitoring solution accuracy and reliability, to Operations Engineers that implement monitoring clients, interpret and react to resulting data. Anyone dealing with a Web or SAAS project could benefit from this paper to better plan project resource and infrastructure allocation. Although not exclusive, our focus is on applications developed using Java technologies, Linux deployments and Open Source tools and solutions. As prerequisites, basic knowledge of Web and SAAS applications is needed.</abstract>

  <bibliography>I&#039;m a software engineer from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. For over two years while studying Computer Science in University, I&#039;ve been involved in the Distributed Systems Research Laboratory as a research assistant, working for both Romanian and European Research Projects. It has taught me team work, analysis, integration, development and presenting my results in publications. Our work then was presented in both Romanian an international conferences and as important publications I can list &quot;ArhiNet – A Knowledge-based System for Creating, Processing and Querying Archival eContent&quot; (Web Information Systems and Technologies, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, Springer, Volume 45, pp. 99-112, 2010) and Model and SOA Solutions for Traceability in Logistic Chains” (The 10th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications &amp; Services (iiWAS2008), Linz, Austria, ISSN 978-1-60558-349-5). Since 2009 I&#039;ve been software engineer with Language Weaver (now part of SDL), a company that offers SAAS solutions for Statistical Machine Translation. I&#039;ve contributed with development, maintenance and operations for the SDL BeGlobal product that comprises of SAAS Applications that allow users to translate and post-edit content using APIs or direct applications, possibly integrated in workflows. I&#039;ve also been involved in infrastructure and operations on other platforms and products that we offer. Besides working in industry, this is my third year as laboratory and project teaching assistant for the Software Design course of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. Because of my affiliation to Transilvania JUG, I&#039;ve attended Jazoon&#039;11 and learned a lot - this is why this year I want to offer from our experience in return.</bibliography>

  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>Within the last years processes became more and more the most important aspects within todays&#039; user software: service oriented architectures are &quot;process oriented&quot; as highest evolutionary stage, SAP PI consolidates all services within business processes, etc.

But do we have the right requirements engineering approaches to cover this appropriately?

In a project three years ago we experienced something completely different, even something new from our point of view: based on Eclipse Process Framework Composer we wanted to know wether we were able to analyze the core processes we need to implement so that we can establish an effective software deployment in a Java Enterprise world. The result was better we ever had dreamt of: we were able to retrieve the requirements for every single tool being part of these processes thus enabling us either to evaluate existing solutions or developing new ones.

In this talk we will show developers, software architects and project managers how we started, what misleading paths we have taken at the beginning, why we switched using Eclipse Process Framework Composer and what we finally found out how to provide requirements.</abstract>

  <title>Yes - we generate!</title>
  <keywords>openArchitectureWare, MDSE, CASE, UML, Eclipse</keywords>
  <topics>6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies</topics>
  <abstract>Model Driven Software Engineering has been a hot topic a few years ago - but what happened to it? Is still somebody using it for software development? the answer is: Yes - we generate!

For the last eight years now we have set-up and enhanced a code generator suite within Eclipse to generate business models, business rules, web services, REST services, GWT based web-applications, mobile applications, database schemas and much more.

In this short presentation we will give software engineers, software architects and business engineers insights on why we have decided to use generators, how we have created them, and how we use openArchitectureWare, Maven 3 and Java together with UML2 exported models provided from Visual Paradigm to quickly implement business applications. Furthermore we provide do&#039;s and don&#039;ts and experiences we made until today such as customization requirements to generate for different customers. Finally we will give an outlook on how we intend to move code generation forward into the world of business processes.</abstract>

  <title>DevOps in the Life-Cycle of a SAAS Application</title>
  <keywords>DevOps, SAAS Operations, Continuous Integration, Backup and Restore, Monitorin</keywords>
  <topics>9.4. Experiences using new approaches like DevOps or LeanStartUp</topics>
  <abstract>This paper addresses the need of DevOps throughout the lifecycle of Software as a Service (SAAS) Applications, to ensure environment and application availability, functionality and good user experience. Operations in SAAS applications require a wide set of knowledge, varying from IT, to Development, QA, Customer Support and Product Functionality. Skilled DevOps are of high importance in the early cycles of the application too, as the development and QA teams rely on them to build, backup, restore and maintain their working environments. Their help is also important in building Continuous Integration and Delivery solutions.

When the application is in staging and production, DevOps gain a lot of responsibility, as the consequences of their actions can directly affect customer experience, functionality, availability and disaster recovery. Our experience shows that the number of DevOps resources required for maintenance of a SAAS application greatly diminishes with the use of CI and CD, of backup and restore solutions, of monitoring tools and aggregation of the data they provide. Improved monitoring and restore plans lead to faster response time to the Customer-facing issues that the application can experience. Also, thorough backup and restore plans and solutions are of high importance, as better planning reduces the risk of under-pressure work required to quickly restore a system’s functions.

The paper is for beginner and intermediate levels and the audience can be mixed, from product managers and scrum masters, to software engineers, DevOps and QA. Anyone could get an insight on the need of Operations throughout the lifecycle of a SAAS or Web application. We focus our examples and experience on Java-based applications deployed on Linux systems and we include Open Source tools and solutions. As prerequisites, basic knowledge of Software Engineering lifecycle and tools is requred.

  <bibliography>I&#039;m a software engineer from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. For over two years while studying Computer Science in University, I&#039;ve been involved in the Distributed Systems Research Laboratory as a research assistant, working for both Romanian and European Research Projects. It has taught me team work, analysis, integration, development and presenting my results in publications. Our work then was presented in both Romanian an international conferences and as important publications I can list &quot;ArhiNet – A Knowledge-based System for Creating, Processing and Querying Archival eContent&quot; (Web Information Systems and Technologies, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, Springer, Volume 45, pp. 99-112, 2010) and Model and SOA Solutions for Traceability in Logistic Chains” (The 10th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications &amp; Services (iiWAS2008), Linz, Austria, ISSN 978-1-60558-349-5). Since 2009 I&#039;ve been software engineer with Language Weaver (now part of SDL), a company that offers SAAS solutions for Statistical Machine Translation. I&#039;ve contributed with development, maintenance and operations for the SDL BeGlobal product that comprises of SAAS Applications that allow users to translate and post-edit content using APIs or direct applications, possibly integrated in workflows. I&#039;ve also been involved in infrastructure and operations on other platforms and products that we offer. Besides working in industry, this is my third year as laboratory and project teaching assistant for the Software Design course of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. Because of my affiliation to Transilvania JUG, I&#039;ve attended Jazoon&#039;11 and learned a lot - this is why this year I want to offer from our experience in return.</bibliography>

  <topics>1.3. PaaS Platforms, Runtimes, Services, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Once upon a time, life as a CRUD developer was easy: design your API, implement your beans, fire up JPA, start a MySQL instance and off we go. MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j, CouchDB and co entering the game developers now have a costly luxury called: freedom of choice!

In this talk we will focus on summing up the differences, similarities and major use-cases of these new databases. We&#039;ll then look into how we used _Redis_, and _MongoDB_ as complements to our PostgreSQL to implement a real-time storage for real-world objects. We&#039;ll focus on the drivers that exist for these DBs in the Java Galaxy. For Mongo, we&#039;ll look at Morphia, the Jackson Mongo Mapper and the official Java driver focusing on the differences between these drivers as well as our general experience using them. For Redis we&#039;ll look at Jedis and JRedis.

Generally speaking the goal of this talk will to help you picking the right database for the right use-cases and to tell you how fun and refreshing it actually was to learn to use these new, powerful and scalable tools.
- Target Audience: software developers/architects without specific NoSQL knowledge but decent Java skills.

  <keywords>QR, NFC, tag, RFID, REST, Android</keywords>
  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 1.6. PaaS/Practical Experience, 4.1. Android Development, 4.5. Hardware related features (NFC, etc.), 8.2. Experiments</topics>
  <abstract>In the vision of the Web of Things, embedded devices become first-class citizens of the Web but what if every day objects could all become part of this gigantic network? What if your watch, guitar, bike or bottle of organic iced-tea could all have an active digital identity on the Web?

With the advent of tagging technologies such as NFC, EPC or QR-codes, this is becoming a reality with a lot of potential for simple but great innovations. In this talk, we&#039;ll first briefly look at these three tagging technologies comparing and contrasting them in order to understand their respective use-case based on our experience deploying such solutions in the real-world.

We will then wear our Java hat (which we wear every day anyways!) and look at the Java tool-set for tagging objects and identifying them. We&#039;ll go hands-on and implement, using Android and the open-source evrythng Java wrapper, a mobile application that can read both NFC and QR tags on products in order to bootstrap the access to their virtual profiles.

Your objects will soon have a Facebook profile, make sure you tag them before they&#039;ll tag you!

  <title>Building data browsers in 15 minutes</title>
  <keywords>reverse engineering, data analysis, visualization</keywords>
  <topics>6.1. IDEs and Plug-ins, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>Interactive browsers are crucial to make complex models accessible. Problem domains often require multiple views to access, interpret and edit the underlying elements. However, browsers are in most cases expensive to create and burdensome to maintain.

In this talk, we demonstrate an open-source engine that makes building custom browsers easy and fun. This engine ships with Moose (http://moosetechnology.org), a platform for software and data analysis. The engine uses a components and connectors architecture, and it comes with an embedded domain specific language that allows the user to build dedicated browsers quickly. It accommodates any kind of domain models via on-the-fly transformations and it enforces a strict and explicit separation between the presentation of the data and the navigation flow between different entities.

This is a technical talk addressed to software engineers. The talk details the conceptual model behind the engine and it is accompanied with live demonstrations of actually building browsers.</abstract>

  <abstract>The Internet of Things, where devices, sensors and objects all can speak the same languages is becoming a reality. Combine the ubiquity of Java with mobile phones and get the ideal gateway for the integration of embedded devices with the Web and the Internet.

In this talk, we will report on our experiences with connecting Android Phones to Arduino embedded computers within the &quot;Ondes Visibles&quot; project, an open source system that lets you monitor the electrosmog with a mobile phone using the sensors of an Arduino board.

We will show how, using your Java skills, you can easily enable communication with the real-world and prototype phone accessories or control home appliances. In a small &quot;Hello-World&quot; tutorial, we&#039;ll implement an Android application that can read data from an Arduino, actuate it and upload it in the cloud.

In tech terms, we&#039;ll look at Android, the Microbridge Java library, Google&#039;s ADK (Accessory Development Kit) standard and the Processing (Java) IDE for Arduino.

Free yourself from the desktop, use your Java skills to implement the Web of Things!

  <title>Secure Business Value through Software Engineering</title>
  <keywords>Business Value, Software Engineering, Agile, Process, Model</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.2. Experiences with applying strategically Lean, Kanban, Scrum and other agile approaches</topics>
  <abstract>Software Engineering is not just about delivering a sound technical solution. Software Engineering is also about the delivery of business benefit.

What secures business benefit? Besides a sound technical solution, business benefit is secured through active user involvement, excellent business work flow designed through evolutionary prototyping and stakeholder consensus that is derived through facilitated workshops.

Underlying the above mentioned critical success factors is Quality, Ownership and Commitment which in return translate to a quality business solution that is embraced by the users, supported by a well-engineered technical solution creating business value.

The planned presentation will focus on four areas and will be delivered in four steps.

1. How a well software engineered solution or an over engineered solution may still not solve the business challenge?

2. Why is the solution not simply the technical solution?

3. How can one bring software engineering more aligned with good delivery business practices? What will this achieve and why?

4. What should be the first steps that anyone should take to align good delivery business practices with software engineering as to guarantee the applicability of common sense?

Throughout the presentation, the audience will be presented with hard facts that are the result of lack of common sense. The presentation will be interactive with the aim to engage the audience and will predominantly focus on real life examples using case studies.

Software Engineering is not about the technology. Software Engineering is about being a catalyst between men and machine as to create a combustion that delivers business value.</abstract>

  <title>Continuous integration for iOS projects</title>
  <keywords>iOS, Continuos Integration</keywords>
  <topics>4.2. iOS Development, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>Building an iOS app has never been an easy task for iOS developers.

Creating an Ad-hoc and AppStore build requires a sequence of steps to be

performed and many assets to be considered:

certificates, provisioning profiles, entitlement file, various settings.

This is prone to human error for sure.

Also, in a multi-developer environment, with many frequent commits/contributions

to the source code, it is a true challenge keeping the build stable at any

moment.

Therefore, my team and iOS department of Netcetera agreed that automating

the process is a necessity.

In this talk, I will present our implementation of Continuous

Integration (CI) and share the practices of its usage in build of iOS

projects.

I will start with a brief overview of Jenkins as a CI service provider and

will show how to perform a basic configuration and execute a job:
- configure mac_slave
- create new job
- execute shell command

Then, will present you the custom build system we implemented in Ruby, by

demonstrating the common CI features and tasks:
- execution of tests
- creation of Ad-hoc and AppStore builds, with application resigning, which speeds up the build process
- deploying a build to a server
- sending reports

We have decided for custom and scalable implementation, because most of the existing solutions had only one or two features listed above.

At the end, I will outline the issues to to considered of CI of a project

and will conclude with the benefits we gained of its usage.</abstract>

  <abstract>This presentation will explain how OSGi is the natural evolution of software development from functions to objects to packages to modules (bundles). But OSGi not only has great modularization up its sleeves: It also comes with a comprehensive notion of module live cycle and a service registry. Turns out that it is this service registry which is one of the most important aspects of OSGi. Which in addition allows OSGi based applications to be extensible out of the box and transparently integrating Java EE functionality like JTA, JNDI, JDBC, and JPA.

This presentation is targetted at software developer and architects. Participants are expected to have basic knowledge in software engineering.</abstract>

  <title>Seducing RESTful APIs</title>
  <keywords>API, REST, documentation, WS-*, Security</keywords>
  <topics>1.3. PaaS Platforms, Runtimes, Services, 2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 3.6. JavaScript On The Server, Node.js, 7.7. API Design (e.g. fluent design, etc)</topics>
  <abstract>REST was a little revolution in the SOA world. Turned down by the complexity of WS-*, many developers and companies moved their APIs to RESTful Webservices which are supposedly easier to use for API users, more lightweight and closer to the core of the Web. WS-* and REST have previously been compared with respect to performance and features, but no work has been done to elicit the developers’ preferences and programming experiences in an objective manner. When designing our APIs at EVRYTHNG, it was key to understand how one or the other technology would influence developers&#039; adoption. Thus, in a study with 69 developers (see http://www.webofthings.org/2012/02/08/ws-vs-rest/), we looked at the developer experience when using both technologies and tried to better grasp what processes or tools could help improving the experience with REST even more.

It turned out that while almost all developers massively favored REST, they had two concerns: security features and interface documentation. Hence, in this talk we will look at both challenges and propose concrete solutions. In terms of security we will try to better understand the concerns and compare the features of both approaches. We will look at simple but yet powerful ways of securing RESTful Webservices, from basic authentication to authorization with oAuth and sharing with social networks.

Then, we will look at documentation. Yes, RESTful APIs should in theory be self-documented. The reality is however slightly different and the documentation of your APIs will have a great impact on their adoption. Hence, we will look at developers-friendly ways of documenting APIs. In particular, we will look at Swagger, a simple and open-standard for documenting REST APIs and its implementation in the Java JAX-RS and Scala world. Furthermore, we&#039;ll compare it with Mashery I/O Docs, a Node.JS interactive documentation server based on Node.JS

During this exploration, we will propose &quot;hello world&quot; types of examples topped with reports of experiences based on the documentation of our JAX-RS based-APIs at EVRYTHNG.
- Target Audience: software-developers/architects, API managers
- Level: intermediate
- Prerequisites required of attendees: some experiences with REST as the goal of this talk will be to go beyond the definition of what REST is about.</abstract>

JAnnocessor is a new open-source framework for powerful, flexible and reliable processing of annotated Java source code. Its main purpose is compile-time annotation-driven source code generation in a declarative and customizable fashion. JAnnocessor is built on top of Java&#039;s APT for reliable compile-time annotation processing, encapsulating it in a rich domain model, convenient for expressive matching and transformation. Finally, a template engine is used for customizable template-based source code generation.</abstract>
  <abstract_plain>Still writing boilerplate code manually? Generate JavaBeans, builders, DAOs, services, facades, DTOs, mappers, etc.

In this talk, the author of JAnnocessor - a novel code generation technology, will show you how easily you can boost your productivity by using Java annotations to automatically generate Java source code. The customization of annotations, code generation logic and code templates will also be covered, so you will be able to generate anything you want in a very convenient way!

  <topics>1.2. Java Containers, 2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 5.1. Enterprise Frameworks, 6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring</topics>
  <abstract>Modern application frameworks promote a POJO-based programming model, and POJOs are inherently easy to unit test. But how can we effectively integration test our application outside the container while still getting as close to a production-like environment as possible? This session will show attendees how to approximate a target production environment using JUnit and the Spring TestContext Framework to drive fast, repeatable, &quot;out-of-container&quot; integration tests. To simulate a live system, the session will cover open source integration testing techniques such as the use of in-memory databases, JMS providers, and Servlet containers as well as mock SMTP and FTP servers. These techniques are not limited to Spring based applications and can be applied to help integration test any modern Java application.</abstract>

  <abstract>Meeting real deadlines is a hard and stressful job. It’s a job that typically eats all resources available, because when we know exactly what the best way is, we want to go full steam ahead. After all, we want to utilize our productivity to the maximum. Except that we typically do not know the best way. We know just a way and we get comfortable with it.

While the status quo can be comfortable, it is certainly not perfect. There always is something to improve. However, when entrenched in a routine we typically have no clue of what that something is and how to improve it.

In this talk we distill some lessons learnt from the time we spent in the research world and in helping companies rethink their approaches. It turns out that the path to follow is not dependent on the domain, and that a set of simple steps can get you quite far:
- Always challenge the status quo, even when it appears perfect.
- Identify the wrong assumptions, especially when they are obvious.
- Demo your ideas, even when they seem hard to implement.
- Listen, even when you do not agree.
- Enable new things to happen.

Of them all, focus on the demo. Relentlessly. Much of the rest will follow. This is the simplicity and power of the demo-driven way.

Why is this relevant? Because it affects everything you do, including the design of your software system, understanding your clients’ requirements, or managing your team. And because the solution is simple and cheap.</abstract>

  <title>Enterprise Architectures for E-Commerce</title>
  <keywords>e-commerce, product development</keywords>
  <topics>10.2. Integration architecture (SOA and the like)</topics>
  <abstract>The US Census Bureau has reported seasonally adjusted quarterly e-commerce retail sales since 1999. The most recent report shows total e-commerce sales for 2011 at just under $200 billion. According to the Economist, this growth from 5% of total retail sales five years ago to 9% now does not reflect that people in their 20s and 30s do about a quarter of their shopping online.

The trend toward E-commerce is being felt in all businesses - not just traditional retail. In particular, E-commerce technologies, which incidentally were among the original drivers of Java servlet technology, already affect other mainstream Enterprise applications.

This presentation covers some e-commerce supporting architectures and technologies that evolved over the last 12 years including personalization, rules engines, randomized trials, analytics, and payment systems. However, like the unexpectedly long list of credits at the end of a Hollywood movie, correctly executed high-performance e-commerce architectures increasingly require not only good technology, well-layed-out content, and good usability, but also the correct execution of essential supporting processes: product development, project management, software architecture, change management and QA. Furthermore, there are supporting roles ranging from the kind of behavioral consultants who are responsible for why grovery stores are always layed out with fruits and vegetables first to machine learning specialists able to accurately predict a person&#039;s age and sex based on the short text of an emailed suggestion or complaint.

Finally this talk briefly covers many peripheral systems that are increasingly becoming tightly integrated into e-commerce architectures - including technologies for cross-channel selling, for spanning call centers and web sites, and other &quot;clicks and bricks&quot; business model related processes.

  <title>Closing the quality gap</title>
  <keywords>quality, continuous improvement, agile, scrum</keywords>
  <topics>11.2. Continuous improvement processes</topics>
  <abstract>Software quality is a primary goal of todays in agile programming methods. But what is software quality? Someone from software engineering will answer that question differently than someone from quality assurance, business engineering or management, as all those groups have completely different expectations. This talk is not about the theory, but about hands on examples I see daily in third level support of a large Application within SIX Group. Through my experiences in the support team, I get to see all the software bugs that occur in the productive environment. How can the code quality be improved? In addition I also see that the software has not met many user expectations. So how can this quality gap between the expectations and the result significantly be reduced?

In the time I worked for this company Scrum was introduced. How did this effect the software quality?

Even though there will be short code examples, the target audience are not only software engineers, but also business engineers and project managers of any level.</abstract>

  <title>Lessons learned in Agile Career Development</title>
  <keywords>Career Development, skill acquisition, career paths, coaching, metrics</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.3. Involving HR/personal management, 11.1. Creating a learning organization, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>Career Development is sometimes left behind or considered an auxiliary ingredient when we talk about building great self-org teams.

Some organizations do not realize the importance that Career Development plays in the overall motivation of people and their retention in a company or when they realize they continue to do the same old/traditional annual plan, which works exactly as the annual review and evaluation: it’s just a bullet to check, nothing else.

On the other hand Agile is often used as an argument to lower the priority of this element and do not measure any progress or do not pay any special attention to it, bringing the argument that at the end “the working software” delivered frequently is enough to prove that the team is professional enough, everyone is motivated and their skills will continue to be good because they are self-motivated so do not need a career development plan.

In this practical presentation I am going to list some of the lessons I have learned in the last 5 years of doing Career Development in Agile environments:
- How HR and management traditionally see career development and the questions we had trying to adopt more Agile principles
- Developing &amp; supporting competence and how career plan fits in this topic: it all starts with hiring, optimizing the whole department, self-development, game storming, coaching, growing standards, techniques to learn more deliberately, collaborative learning, managing focus
- Dilemmas and false friends along the way: specialist/generalist, architect/manager, Peter’s principle, layer vs feature, career aspirations vs skills forecasting, career path antipatterns
- A never ending journey and how we implemented the Dreyfus model
- Career Development metrics: metrics we found useful, patterns, anomalies, outliers and why “inspect and adapt” rocks again!
- Reading recommendations

This presentation is full of recipes that have started to work and are subject to continuous improvement in the environments where I contributed as an Engineering Manager.

  <paper_external_comment>I spoke about Career Development to students at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca/Romania being invited by a student organization and I had similar presentations in my company. 

It&#039;s the perspective of someone striving to find better ways, learning from others (IBM but also successful startups, for instance), improving and discovering errors every month.

  <title>Soft skills &amp; hard fists on a fixed price project</title>
  <keywords>project management, agile, behavioural, fixed price project</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 11.2. Continuous improvement processes, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>Applying Agile methodologies while being suffocated by a fix price contract on one side and a demanding customer on the other. Sounds familiar, right?

Imagine the scenario:
- Project sold on a fix price basis
- Murky and rushed requirements
- A half finished prototype
- A tug of war ensues between the fixed price project mentality of a PM vs. the customer’s sweet, sweet need to add more stuff in.

In a short amount of time, I will present some ideas on how to make the best of a bad situation using some behavioral analysis and how to handle the situations that make you want to forget about soft skills and use hard fists.

Target audience are project managers and to a lesser degree software developers, no prerequisite knowledge required.

  <title>How to get information on a map</title>
  <keywords>map frameworks, GWT, Solr, geo-spatial search</keywords>
  <topics>2.2. RIA Frameworks, Java or JavaScript based, 3.5. JavaScript Frameworks, Tools, Libraries</topics>
  <abstract>Taking an alternative approach to present results for arbitrary searches, we use technologies like GWT, Google Maps and the new spatial search features of Solr to let a user interact with a search system. The basis of this system is the tagging of all infroamtion with geo-coordinates. This allows Solr to perform a spatial search on this information.

We take the idea of presenting search results on a map one step further and aggregate different pieces of information on this map.

Using standard Open Source technologies like Google Web Toolkit and Google Maps as well as Solr, we show how to put together a small prototype that displays a regional map and reacts to different types of user input like moving the mouse over the map or typing text into a search field.

We explain, how the interaction with the frontend is handled through GWT and sent to a search backend using Solr to find information appropriate for the coordinates.

Special attention is given to the expanation of the different components and to the possible methods for translating text input into geo-coordinates. The talk ends with some remarks about mobile devices and how to incorporate them into the picture.</abstract>

  <title>Do enterprise-wide software metrics work?</title>
  <keywords>Sonar,Unittest,Metrics,Java,Quality</keywords>
  <topics>6.2. Testing, Profiling, Monitoring, 6.3. Software Engineering Lifecycle and Methodologies, 6.6. Build Management</topics>
  <abstract>Target Audience: Developers, Software Architects, Project Managers, Quality Managers

Level: Intermediate

Prerequisites: Experience with software development

In a heterogenous environment like a large cooperation with various kinds of different applications, how can enterprise-wide software quality improvement measures be applied? Is there any relevant common ground, can common rules really improve quality? Is there any method that applies to almost any kind of software project?

Projects focus on short term goals and customer requirements. But at SBB software typically has a lifecycle of ten, often even twenty years. This talk will show how SBB Informatik tried and tries to improve (inner) software quality with special focus on maintainability.

For many years, SBB has invested considerably into individually built software with software quality control measures mainly left to the projects themselves. This has led to a very heterogeneous picture of software quality within the different projects and products and to corresponding issues in software maintenance.

In an initiative to improve this situation
- Sonar was introduced as an openly accessible metrics tool
- Several basic policies where introduced (including an new edition of coding guidelines)
- Sonar rules where calibrated to match the guidelines
- SQALE Plugin was introduced and calibrated for a coarse quality measurement and calibrated management view

During the talk, the implications such an automated measurement had at SBB will be discussed. How to get to an agreement on common rules, what is required technically in build technology? What obstacles and issues did we encounter, technically and especially non-technically?

The talk will conclude with an assessment of the current results we achieved and the effort required, compared to the put previously into similar efforts in some of the IT projects at SBB, and the advantages and disadvantages of a global effort.</abstract>

  <keywords>self-organization</keywords>
  <topics>11.3. Supporting innovations without bargaining sustainability, 11.4. Supporting self-organizing teams</topics>
  <abstract>The key word in the title is &quot;product&quot;. Most developers have ideas for potentially useful and lucrative software to develop, but many have only a hazy idea about what differentiates a cool idea from a true product that can succeed in the market. Even with clever algorithms and an elegant user interface, a new software product can lose to technically-inferior competitors, never gain traction with customers, or vanish without a trace with none the wiser. This is often attributed to a lack of &quot;marketing&quot; (sometimes meaning advertising, or perhaps sales techniques) but actually happens because crucial aspects of product design are ignored or dealt with ineffectively. Developers are often kept unaware of the &quot;business&quot; side of their discipline, but could benefit from knowing more about it; they could increase the chances of success for their work, derive real satisfaction from more effectively addressing their users&#039; and customers&#039; problems, and potentially even start their own successful businesses by having a clearer understanding of product management.

This talk will explore the basics of product management for developers and compare and contrast it with professional services, academic, and institutional development, with examples. Topics covered will include:

1. Questions you must be able to answer clearly

2. How to differentiate between a product and a feature

3. Ongoing product process

4. Overlap with design and user experience

5. Messaging

6. Customer input

7. Roadmap planning, schedules, and the interaction with development methodologies such as agile.

  <abstract>Apache CXF is an open source project at apache. This framework allows to service enable your applications using Web Services or REST technology. Its capabilities are built on top of an extensible core framework which allows easy adaption in companies. The project is a merger of the open source projects XFire and Celtix and available in release 2.5 today. The framework supports contract-first as well as implementation first methodologies. The presentation gives an introduction into the architecture of CXF and how different enterprise topics can be implemented with CXF. A concrete use case illustrates how a Single Sign On enabled web application federates the identities to web services using WS-Trust and SAML and shows how to deploy the application to the cloud.</abstract>

  <title>Scalable and Flexible Behavior Analytics</title>
  <keywords>behavior analytics, human-computer interaction</keywords>
  <topics>1.1. App Stores, Rules, Programming Models, 1.6. PaaS/Practical Experience, 5.4. Real-Time Processing, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices</topics>
  <abstract>For application developers and service providers, monitoring and analyzing the behavior of end-users has always been important, for several reasons. In the area of human-computer interaction, understanding user behavior is important to idenfity and fix usability issues. In the area of monetization, understanding user behavior is key for pricing applications and features, running promotion campaigns, etc. For these reasons, every company launching an internet/mobile/cloud service should have an analytics solution in place, from day one. Building scalable and flexible analytics platforms is a challenging endeavour, given the volume of activity seen by popular applications. In this session, our goal is to look at analytics solutions from two perspectives. Firstly, we will highlight the importance of analytics and review typical use cases and scenarios. Secondly, we will look at the technologies used to build scalable analytics platforms. We will compare different SQL and NoSQL solutions (including mysql, mongoDB, redis, hadoop, mahout) and highlight their relative strenghts and limitations. In the session, we will share some of the learnings made while building the Lotaris analytics platform, used by customers such as Sega.

  <abstract>The Integration Trap - Why system integration is simple but fails

We live in the century of globalization. This also applies to IT. More and more business processes cover multiple systems inside and outside the local system landscape. For this reason appropriate concepts to implement business features over system landscapes become more and more important. But these concepts often sound simpler than they are. This talk gives an overview of the most important problems in system integration and provides possible solutions (or at least how to deal with these problems in practice). </abstract>

  <title>Agile Development within the Corporation</title>
  <keywords>large and distributed agile</keywords>
  <topics>9.1. Agile development as a business strategy, 9.3. Involving HR/personal management</topics>
  <abstract>Every agile approach takes place within a given context - the corporation. Agile product or project development, especially within large corporation are facing here specific challenges provided by the larger framework. The common departmental structure is often experienced more like a burden than support. As well the organization&#039;s structure (yes, and of course as well its culture) can be experienced as being more or less helpful. Yet still, in order to become successful the agile undertaking has to deal with these challenges.

In this session, I want to explore how departments like Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Sales, yet as well Quality Control, or Operations can support and how can they hinder agility. Despite the challenges, the focus is on leveraging the departments in order to become successful. Thus, involving everyone who is affected early on and making them part of the agile approach is crucial. This session is based on my experiences working in large and distributed corporations, yet the variety of the participants&#039; experience will make all the difference.

  <abstract>The skills of building Scalable, Highly Concurrent and Fault-Tolerant Systems are becoming increasingly important in our new world of Cloud Computing, multi-core processors, Big Data and Real-Time Web. Unfortunately, many people are still doing it wrong; using the wrong tools, techniques, habits and ideas. In this talk we will look at some of the most common (and some not so common but superior) practices; what works - what doesn&#039;t work - and why.

  <title>How to become a hero to the marketing team (or business users) by using the work of others</title>
  <keywords>web cms, magnolia</keywords>
  <topics>2.1. Java Web Frameworks, 2.4. REST: patterns, best practices, 7.6. Design Patterns and Best Practices, 8.1. Architectures worth knowing</topics>
  <abstract>If you are not stuck behind a 70&#039;s style green on black monitor you probably have heard that the web ain&#039;t what it used to be. No longer does it suffice to generate a more or less static web site (brochure ware) – these days your business, organization or public administration needs a deep back end integration into your custom business logic and the heart of your organization to provide a unique customer, member or citizen experience. While Java is what you are comfy with, bringing these transactional processes to the web and the mobile requires knowledge of CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, Accessibility and SEO best practices to name but a few. As a Java dev, you might not exactly thrive in maintaining CSS cross browser incompatibilities. Even if you do (please apply for a job with us!), the fact that your marketing department needs to roll out constant new micro sites for their campaigns and your website needs to run in 22 different languages and now you need a mobile and iPad site as well doesn&#039;t exactly lessen the pressure on you. So how can you ensure your business and marketing teams can be agile, and you can focus on the stuff where you really provide value to your organization?

In this talk, we will show you how Virtual Presence, as we call the deep business integration into online channels, is becoming mainstream, and how you can master the requirements by using an open and flexible CMS like Magnolia instead of trying to reinvent wheels.

The talk will explain various aspects of a virtual presence and why it can make sense for you to look at content management with a fresh eye – less as a system to write and publish content and more as a platform to build integrated business solutions for the 21st century. Spring developers will get a little extra treatment, as Magnolia has an excellent Spring integration module, but we&#039;ll also cover other core services like caching, security, mobile publishing, data storage and templating.

This talk will be technical but with a distinct focus on business problems and how to use a CMS to address them. Any system architect or Java developer should benefit from the talk.

  <title>Building Scaleable Applications with MongoDB</title>
  <keywords>mongodb, nosql</keywords>
  <topics>1.3. PaaS Platforms, Runtimes, Services, 1.7. Distributed Architectures</topics>
  <abstract>MongoDB – from &quot;humongous&quot; – is an open source, non-relational, document-oriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of databases (notably joins and transactions) in order to achieve much better performance, MongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web development. The goal of the MongoDB project is to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which provide rich queries and deep functionality).

(optional details) This talk will cover:

Getting started - CRUD and the JavaScript shell

Creating schemas for a document-oriented DB

Scaling with MongoDB (replica sets, master/slave, auto-sharding)

Interesting features for developers (geospatial indexing, capped collections, file storage, upserts and more)</abstract>

The goal of the MongoDB project is to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which provide rich queries and deep functionality).

(optional details) This talk will cover:

Getting started - CRUD and the JavaScript shell

Creating schemas for a document-oriented DB

Scaling with MongoDB (replica sets, master/slave, auto-sharding)

Interesting features for developers (geospatial indexing, capped collections, file storage, upserts and more)</abstract_plain>

  <abstract>The future of technology is racing towards us with new platforms, languages, tools, paradigms, practices, databases, hardware and frameworks … all to be applied to new products and applications. Given all these new technologies are almost here we speculate on the potential nature of software development in the latter part of the decade. Will our sacred rituals of Sequential Programs, Tables, Objects, Patterns, Tags and Agile be legacy or still the way for software professionals? How should we expand our reach - what skills, practices, languages, platforms will be important? Will we be eaten by the complexity dragon or slay it with some essential simplicity that allows faster, cheaper, better software development and delivery?</abstract>

  <abstract>Fed off with your continuous integration staying red all the time? Tired of seeing the tests failing over and over? How can we make continuous integration visible to every one?

With a bit of imagination, a soldering iron or your programming skills, it is possible to implicate your team members with current build status, test coverage and so on. Let it be a LCD screen, a lave lamp or a rabbit, it is easy to bring some fun at work!

During this talk I will share my own experience on moving from cubicles to a live open space and sharing the continuous integration status with managers while having fun. Setting a large LCD screen for continuous integration monitoring is actually a good social experience about pointing out the pain.

It is also about live experiences as I would like to demonstrate how simple a continuous integration monitor can be and how cute a electronic rabbit moving ears is. The talk is opened to every one interested in agile practices as it is all about feedback and to the more technical ones looking for ideas to practice their development skills.</abstract>

  <title>An Empirical Look at Controversial Java Features</title>
  <keywords>study, java features, language design, core java, </keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Rookie</topics>
  <abstract>Programming languages add features over time to aid developers in their day to day programming. For example, Java 7 introduced several features (reduced generics syntax, safe file handling, making large numbers readable and more) as part of &#039;Project Coin&#039; to make a Java programmer&#039;s life simpler. However, are all new language features desirable or useful?

You can use empirical studies to understand how programming language features are used in practice and whether they solve the intended problem.

In this talk, we present recent empirical studies about controversial and hotly debated Java features: generics, wildcards, covariant arrays and annotations.

The attendance will learn new surprising facts about how these core features are used in practice. For example:
- Seven years later, have generics helped reduce type casts and code duplication?
- Covariant arrays are often seen as a language design error, but do programmers care?
- What do programmers use wildcards for?
- What are the most frequently used annotations?</abstract>

  <title>Next generation web development with node.js and meteor</title>
  <keywords>node.js,javascript,meteor.js,web</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Rookie</topics>
  <abstract>Web development is an ever-changing field and there are a lot of different technologies on the market. Among them is the - relatively speaking - newcomer node.js and the yet not widely known meteor.js.

Both allow writing web applications with Javascript on client- and server-side while introducing a new way of programming web applications - away from OOP and imperative to functional and event-driven programming.

This presentation gives an overview on the different paradigms and technologies, their up- and downsides and give a short intro into node.js / nodester and meteor.js.

Meteor.js is especially interesting, because it weakens the border between the server and the client and speeds up development pace enormously, yet it is widely unknown among software developers of all skill levels.

This talk is intended for web developers with a basic knowledge of Javascript.</abstract>

  <title>Autonomic Computing: Vision or Reality</title>
  <keywords>autonomic computing, artifical intelligence, IBM, distributed computing, service oriented computing</keywords>
  <topics>4.1. Rookie</topics>
  <abstract>At the beginning of the last decade, IBM predicted a problem similar to the US telephony problem of 1920 [1]. In 1920, the rapid adoption of the telephone and its frequent use in households, generated an uncertainty that there would not be enough telephone operators to work the switchboards [2]. It has been predicted that every woman in the US, by the 1980 would need to operate the manual switchboards. This would have been the case if not for the invention of the automatic branch exchanges [3].

Similarly, IBM in 2001 pointed out the same problem regarding the widespread use of computer systems [2, 4].

IBM&#039;s prediction stated that until the end of the decade (2010) the IT sector would need 200 million workers to maintain trillion devices [2, 3]. As a comparison to the extremes of the predicted numbers, the whole labour force of the United States is 200 million workers. This prediction spawned the creation of the manifesto of Autonomic Computing where IBM first introduced and coined the term.

According to Paul Horn, Senior Vice President of Research at IBM [4], businesses, humans and devices require the constant services of the IT industry to maintain them. Furthermore, the complexity of the systems and their interdependencies create a lack of professional IT personnel to manage said systems [5]. As human dependency on technology grew exponentially, so did the problem of managing computer systems. The problem would persist, as long as systems do not develop self-managing capabilities, in order to guarantee that their users will not dip into the complexity of the systems.

The term autonomic computing, as coined by IBM, is also inspired by the term autonomic nervous system. The purpose of this new computing paradigm is to transfer the definition of technology, from computing to data [5]. The main idea is to allow the users to access information from multiple distributed points, with great transparency to how this is achieved [6, 7]. Moreover, this shift in paradigms, as presented by IBM, will need to change the focus of the IT industry, from increasing the processing speed and storage capacity to developing large distributed networks which are self-managing [8], self-diagnostic and transparent to use.

The presentation will introduce the participants to the Autonomic Computing paradigm as defined by IBM a decade ago, will display the advances in this field by associations such as NASA and will briefly focus on the Archimedes system (a research prototype) which takes the Autonomic Computing concepts and applies them to the Service Oriented Paradigm, mainly web services and SaaS applications by decentralizing the service discovery mechanism using self-organizing properties of the systems.

The presentation will introduce the participants to the Autonomic Computing paradigm as defined by IBM a decade ago, will display the advances in this field by associations such as NASA and will briefly focus on the Archimedes system (a research prototype) which takes the Autonomic Computing concepts and applies them to the Service Oriented Paradigm, mainly web services and SaaS applications by decentralizing the service discovery mechanism using self-organizing properties of the systems.

  <title>Agile Chartering: Energize Every Project Liftoff</title>
  <keywords>agile chartering, liftoff, </keywords>
  <topics>0.1. Keynote</topics>
  <abstract>As the first act of the flight, a rocket launch requires an entire set of systems to successfully lift the vehicle into orbit – not just the vehicle itself, but all the systems needed for smoothly moving off the ground into space. Likewise, your project team needs its entire set of supporting systems in place to begin a successful journey to effective teamwork, high performance, and high value delivery. Liftoff – it&#039;s the unexplored, often ignored, Agile software development project practice.

Agile Chartering ignites your project Liftoff in a way that gives impetus to the project team, and the business, and sets the endeavor on the trajectory to success. Project leaders and team members use Agile Chartering to inform, inspire, and align everyone involved in product delivery. Experience a journey through the framework for effective, yet lightweight, &quot;just enough&quot; Agile chartering, including the three key elements of inspiring Purpose, collaborative Alignment, and dynamic Context. Learn why real-life team members say Agile Chartering provided the initial momentum that powered their projects toward success.

In this high energy keynote, Diana Larsen, co-author of Liftoff: Launching Agile Teams and Projects, will take you on an exploration of ways to accomplish team and project Liftoffs, including the vital step of chartering the project.

  <title>IBM Watson since Jeopardy!</title>
  <keywords>ibm watson, natural language processing</keywords>
  <topics>0.1. Keynote</topics>
  <abstract>In February 2011, IBM demonstrated it&#039;s latest Research breakthroughs in natural language processing and deep question answering. Named Watson, it made history when it was entered into the famously complex US television quiz-show &#039;Jeopardy!&#039; where it comfortably beat two of the greatest human players ever to appear on the show. Since then, work has focused on bringing these breakthroughs to real-world problems. Dale will talk about the work that has been happening since Jeopardy! and some of the plans for Watson&#039;s future.</abstract>

  <title>Stay Human - on the future of men and robots</title>
  <keywords>n/a</keywords>
  <topics>0.1. Keynote</topics>
  <abstract>Our technological future hold so much promise - and it poses so many

threats to life as we know it. This ambivalent relation to technology

has become a central part of human thinking in the past decades, and

has become a key issue in our efforts to define humanity, as

technological advances accelerate around us. Nowhere do our hopes and

fears of future development appear stronger than in the meeting with

the technology that looks like us: The android. By using his own

lifelike android as point of departure, Professor Scharfe explores how

new technologies may cause us to think differently about our future -

and about ourselves.

The take home message of this unusual keynote is: Embrace new

technologies - but Stay Human where it really matters.

  <bibliography>Henrik Scharfe (1968) is PhD and Professor of Information Science, Department of Communication, Aalborg University (AAU), Denmark.
Henrik Scharfe has been employed by AAU since 1999 as PhD fellow, Assistant, Associate, and full Professor. Since 2008, he has served as Director of Center for Computer-mediated Epistemology at AAU. His diverse career includes contributions to seemingly distinct research areas such as: Narratology, AI / Knowledge Representation, Persuasive Design, Human Centered Robotics, and Research Infrastructures.

The common denominator in these efforts is his determination to understand different aspects of human understanding, specifically how technology influences the way we think about ourselves and our world. Scharfe has served as reviewer, editorial member, and advisor to governments and research councils in equally diverse fields.

Professor Scharfe has gained global attention for his latest project: the Geminoid-DK. The ultra-realistic android, modeled in the professor’s likeness, has startled millions of people around the world. This work has earned the Professor a reputation as a passionate international speaker, and influencer of many. Merits include:
- TED speaker at TED2012 and TEDActive2012 among others
- 2012 TIME 100 Honoree</bibliography>
